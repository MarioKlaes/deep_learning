       "['Watchdog probes Vivendi bond sale\\n\\nFrench stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive.\\n\\nIt believes the prospectus for a bond issue was unclear and that executives may have had privileged information. AMF has begun proceedings against Vivendi, its chief executive Jean-Rene Fourtou and chief operating officer Jean-Bernard Levy. Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing. Deutsche Bank, which was responsible for selling the convertible bonds to investors, could face penalties if the complaint is upheld.\\n\\nVivendi has said it believes there is \"no legal basis\" for the complaints. The watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to \"privileged information\" surrounding the issue of the bonds. Both men bought some of the bonds, the Associated Press news agency reported. AMF is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in Vivendi\\'s US assets from investor Marvin Davis, at the time of the bond sale. Vivendi, however, has said that the information was public knowledge as Mr Davis\\' offer for the US assets had already been rejected by Vivendi\\'s board. AMF is also looking into whether the executives knew that Vivendi was considering exercising its right to buy British Telecom\\'s shares in Cegetel. Vivendi has rejected the charge, saying the decision to buy the Cegetel shares was \"no more than a possibility, of which the public was perfectly aware\" at the time of the bond issue. Back in December, Vivendi and its former chief executive Jean-Marie Messier were each fined 1m euros ($1.3m; Â£690,000) by AMF. The fines came after a 15-month probe into allegations that the media giant misled investors after a costly acquisition programme went wrong.\\n',\n",
       " 'Beatles suits sell for $110,000\\n\\nFour suits worn by the Beatles on their Please Please Me album cover have sold for $110,00 (Â£59,000) at a US auction.\\n\\nBut some of Elvis Presley\\'s earliest recordings - including takes of All Shook Up - failed to sell at the Bonhams and Butterfields two-day sale. A private collection of six tape recordings of Presley valued at between $30,000 (Â£16,000) and $50,000 (Â£27,000) did not meet their reserve price. A signed Presley photograph managed to fetch $2,115 (Â£1,140).\\n\\nAuction spokesman Erik Simon said the Presley tapes were withdrawn because \"they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners\".\\n\\nHe said the family of sound engineer Thorne Nogar did not want to divulge the price they had set or the offers they had received. The RCA tapes date from September 1956 to September 1957. The \"pre-masters\" include a take of Jailhouse Rock, religious songs, material for his first Christmas album, and banter between Presley, members of his band and Mr Nogar.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve had them for a lot of years, and I think the people should enjoy them. And frankly, we could use the money,\" Mr Nogar\\'s son Stephen, 57, said before the auction. Mr Nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back-up in case RCA producers wanted to make late changes to songs. \"He called them his \\'ass-saver\\' tapes,\" his son said. The quality is said to be noticeably crisper than that of a new vinyl record. Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes could only be sold for \"personal enjoyment\" and cannot be copied for commercial gain. The auction made a total of $1.1m (Â£600,000).\\n',\n",

But Bernie Mandic said: \"He\\'s had scans which don\\'t show anything substantial. \"But despite his best efforts at the moment he simply can\\'t shake off the discomfort and get back on the park.\"\\n\\nMandic continued in the Sydney Morning Herald: \"Harry\\'s struggling a bit but the club are doing everything they can to get him right. \"Harry was desperate to be fit for the Fulham game as part of his plan to play himself in for the Leverkusen match.\" Kewell has not played since December 19 and misses out on international duty this week, with Australia facing South Africa in Durban on Wednesday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mobile games come of age\\n\\nThe BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below.\\n\\nIf you think of Snake when some mentions \"mobile games\" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia\\'s N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.\\n\\nAnd given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles, such as Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles.\\n\\nThere are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost Â£5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics.\\n\\nThe minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a \"ghost\" or \"shadow\" to see if you can beat them. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.\\n\\n TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES) \\n\\nAs soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games - because I\\'m rubbish at them. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.\\n\\n FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) \\n\\nA futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps.\\n',\n",
       " 'Connors boost for British tennis\\n\\nFormer world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.\\n\\nThe American spent three days at the LTA\\'s annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week. \"Britain has the right attitude,\" said Connors. \"The more involved I can be with the LTA, the better. \"A short-term arrangement is just confusing. The kids will ask: \\'What am I doing there?\\'\" LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: \"The relationship that Jimmy\\'s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we\\'d like some more of it. \"We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.\"\\n\\nThe camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players, including Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar and Anne Keothavong. \"La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best,\" said Connors, speaking at Queen\\'s Club in London. \"What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. \"It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. \"Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can\\'t buy. \"They know what\\'s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort, and every minute of practice they were doing that.\"\\n\\nSpeaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told BBC Sport: \"Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he\\'s achieved. \"He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he\\'ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. \"He made it clear from the word go he didn\\'t want it to be short-term. This is a 52-week-a-year job for me, it\\'s my life and my passion and it\\'s the same with the coaches. \"He respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. And why would he stake his reputation on something that\\'s not going to be successful?\" Connors has also agreed to commentate for the BBC at next year\\'s Wimbledon Championships. He will work during the second week of the tournament.\\n',\n",
       " 'Minister hits out at Yukos sale\\n\\nRussia\\'s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned.\\n\\nEconomy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was \"unjustified\". His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm\\'s assets into public ownership. On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale \"the swindle of the century\". Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos\\' output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal.\\n\\nBaikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom. \"We used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,\" Andrei Illarionov - then economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin - told a press conference. \"Now officials are doing it.\" Within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.\\n\\nMr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov\\'s comments. The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. But he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. \"I think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.\" And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. \"If we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,\" he said. Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.\\n\\nMr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin\\'s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. The assault on Yukos\\' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. \"The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people\\'s lives,\" Mr Gref told Kommersant. \"We don\\'t need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure.\" Instead of focusing on headline growth figures, Russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lib Dems \\'to target stamp duty\\'\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first-time house buyers.\\n\\nVince Cable, the party\\'s Treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to Â£150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home-buyers from paying the tax. He said first-time buyers were being \"squeezed out\" of the housing market. The Labour party said the Liberal Democrats needed to explain how they would pay for the plan. The plan forms part of a wider Lib Dems policy to encourage first time buyers and those on lower incomes into the market.\\n\\nUnder the proposals, the average saving for a new buyer would be more than Â£1,000, according to Mr Cable. \"First time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net,\" he said. \"By failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold Gordon Brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest. \"By pledging to increase the threshold to Â£150,000, the Liberal Democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax.\" Paul Boateng MP, Labour\\'s Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: \"The Lib Dems\\' sums don\\'t add up. \"They can have no credibility until they can say how they would fund their ever growing list of tax and spending commitments.\" Mr Cable will publish his \"Alternative Budget\" on Monday.\\n',\n",
       " 'BT offers equal access to rivals\\n\\nBT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.\\n\\nThe move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\". At the time, Ofcom offered BT the choice of change or splitting into two. Ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the UK telecom sector. BT\\'s competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.\\n\\nThis latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.\\n\\n\"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT\\'s local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement. \"The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said. \"BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat.\\n\\nThe group is to set up a new Access Services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the \"local loop\", the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand.\\n\\nIt added that it plans to invest Â£10bn in the next five years to create a \"21st Century network\". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.\\n\\nTelecom analysts Ovum welcomed the move, saying BT had \"given a lot of ground\".\\n\\n\"The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT\\'s proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said. Internet service provider (ISP) Plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if Ofcom accepts them\". \"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. The scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,\" chief executive Lee Strafford said. Chris Panayis, managing director of ISP Freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. \"I think it\\'s the first productive thing we\\'ve had from BT,\" he said.\\n\\nAOL backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field. \"This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK\\'s local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said. \"Ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [IPStream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.\" More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase. Ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months.\\n',\n",
       " \"IBM puts cash behind Linux push\\n\\nIBM is spending $100m (Â£52m) over the next three years beefing up its commitment to Linux software.\\n\\nThe cash injection will be used to help its customers use Linux on every type of device from handheld computers and phones right up to powerful servers. IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.\\n\\nIn 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. They reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.\\n\",\n",

She added: \"UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.\" The select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-University in 2000 had been caught up in the \"general atmosphere of enthusiasm\" surrounding the internet. Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least Â£110m in profit.\\n\\nBut virtually no market research was carried out and just Â£4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. Some Â£14m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. This was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had \"too much freedom to spend public money as it wished\", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: \"UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money. \"The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme.\" The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but \"should learn the lessons from this disaster\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Yukos heading back to US courts\\n\\nRussian oil and gas company Yukos is due in a US court on Thursday as it continues to fight for its survival.\\n\\nThe firm is in the process of being broken up by Russian authorities in order to pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) tax bill. Yukos filed for bankruptcy in the US, hoping to use international business law to halt the forced sale of its key oil production unit, Yuganskneftegas. The unit was however sold for $9.4bn to state oil firm Rosneft but only after the state auction had been disrupted.\\n\\nYukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company and its main shareholders have vowed to go after any company that buys its assets, using all and every legal means. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Judge Letitia Clark will hear different motions, including one from Deutsche Bank to throw out the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. The German lender is one of six banks that were barred from providing financing to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that was expected to win the auction for Yuganskneftegas. Deutsche Bank, which is also an advisor to Gazprom, has called on the US court to overturn its decision to provide Yukos with bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nLifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank\\'s business position, analysts said.\\n\\nAnalysts are not optimistic about Yukos\\' chances in court. Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country\\'s legal authorities have repeatedly said that the US has no jurisdiction over Yukos and its legal wranglings. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. \"Do we have an ability to influence what happens? We think we do,\" said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman. \"The litigation risks are real,\" said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Vadim Mitroshin The dispute with the Russian authorities is partly driven by President Putin\\'s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sun offers processing by the hour\\n\\nSun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.\\n\\nSun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour\\'s worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun. So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.\\n\\nThe system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said Sun\\'s chief operating officer Jonathan Schwartz. \"Why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?\" he asked in a webcast launching Sun\\'s quarterly Network Computing event in California. The company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.\\n\\nSome of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said. Mr Schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. Hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.\\n\\nAlthough it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (Â£6.30) because it had used up 12 hours\\' worth of computing power. The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun. Initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. It has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in IBM, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by Sun.\\n',\n",

The government hopes to increase the number of mobile users from 95 million to between 200 and 250 million by 2007. \"We need at least $20bn (Â£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment,\" said Mr Maran. The decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties, which give crucial support to the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said. Key positions, such as those of chief executive, chief technology officer and chief financial officer are to be held by Indians, he added.\\n\\nAnalysts and investors have welcomed the government decision. \"It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market,\" said Gartner\\'s principal analyst Kobita Desai. \"The FDI relaxation coupled with rapid local market growth could really ignite interest in the Indian telecommunication industry,\" added Ernst and Young\\'s Sanjay Mehta. Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India\\'s mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007. The Indian mobile market is currently dominated by four companies, Bharti Televentures which has allied itself with Singapore Telecom, Essar which is linked with Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa, the Sterling group and the Tata group.\\n',\n",

It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal\\'s US affiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. Novartis\\' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading.\\n\\nThe deal will see Novartis\\' Sandoz business overtake Israel\\'s Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world\\'s biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the company estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts.\\n\\n\"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost.\\n\\nThere are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. However, not all analysts were initially convinced about the deal. \"This is a very expensive acquisition,\" Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. \"I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure.\"\\n',\n",

And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas. Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan. Luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the Six Nations game against Italy last weekend.\\n\\nHowever, the experienced and in-form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. \"Due to his impressive performances from the bench, Kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal gives him the chance to start,\" said Ruddock. \"Now that Ryan Jones has recovered from injury, we have increased the options in the back row. \"Jonathan Thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail. \"For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. \"Obviously, it\\'s a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.\" Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. \"Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should \\'be bold\\' when going to France, and he was proved right,\" said Ruddock. \"That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.\"\\n\\nG Thomas (Toulouse, capt); K Morgan (Newport-Gwent), T Shanklin (Cardiff), G Henson (Neath-Swansea), S Williams (Neath-Swansea); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Llanelli); G Jenkins (Cardiff), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones; (Neath-Swansea), B Cockbain (Neath-Swansea), R Sidoli (Cardiff); R Jones (Neath-Swansea), M Williams (Cardiff), M Owen (Newport-Gwent).\\n\\nReplacements: R McBryde (Llanelli), J Yapp (Cardiff), J Thomas (Neath-Swansea), R Sowden-Taylor (Cardiff), G Cooper (Newport-Gwent), C Sweeney Newport-Gwent), R Williams (Cardiff).\\n',\n",

But the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow American Robby Ginepri in straight sets, 6-2 6-2, in California. Despite that he was happy with his Tour debut. \"It was fun. I had my chances, but they didn\\'t come through,\" he said. Young, who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14, was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. And Ginepri - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.\\n\\n\"He\\'s very talented,\" said Ginepri. \"He\\'s got a long future ahead of him. \"Being left-handed, he was very quick around the court. \"His serve is a little deceptive.

At his weekly press conference on Tuesday he said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. He said to media representatives: \"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong.\" The mayor said his comments would not affect the 2012 Olympic bid and added that his determination to stand up for what he believed in may impress bid chiefs, who arrived in London on Tuesday. \"I think it is important that the IOC (International Olympic Committee) members realise that when we get the games...they have a mayor who is not going to panic, change course or get in a great flap but will deliver the games on time and to budget,\" he said.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the mayor said he would be making a full written response to the chairman of the assembly. Two motions were passed by the London Assembly, which is made up of 25 members elected to examine the mayor\\'s activities, on Monday asking him to apologise and withdraw his comments. The mayor said he had recounted to the assembly a number of \"examples of intrusion by journalists\" into his, and his family\\'s private life. \"I don\\'t suggest for one minute that has anything to do with the Holocaust which was uniquely the most evil chapter in history. \"But when reporters say to me I\\'m only doing this because it\\'s my job... that\\'s the same abdication of moral responsibility at the thin end of the wedge that in its most extreme and horrific version ends up with others being prepared to stand as a concentration camp guard.\\n\\n\"We are responsible for our own choices in this life, I always have been and so have reporters.\" An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the Board of Deputies of British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England.

Paris-based Euronext, owner of Liffe in London, has also said it is interested in bidding for LSE. Euronext is due to hold talks with LSE this week and it is reported to be ready to raise Â£1.4bn to fund a bid.

Deutsche Boerse chief Werner Seifert is meeting Ms Furse on Thursday, in the third meeting between the two exchanges since the bid approach in December.\\n\\nThe LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse\\'s proposed Â£1.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business.\\n\\nBut it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\nAccording to the FT, in its latest meeting Deutsche Boerse will adopt a charm offensive to woo the London exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm. Other reports this week said the Deutsche Boerse might even consider selling its Luxembourg-based Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions. Its ownership of Clearstream was seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. LSE shareholders feared a Deutsche Boerse takeover would force them to use Clearstream, making it difficult for them to negotiate for lower transaction fees.\\n',\n",

She praised Celtic and Rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with Old Firm matches is a key objective. Ms Jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round Scottish Cup clash between the Glasgow clubs at Parkhead on Sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters\\' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.\\n\\nThey plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Sunday Live programme, Ms Jamieson described Friday\\'s meeting as \"very productive\" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. Ms Jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a \"trigger\" for tensions and violence. Clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters\\' groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem.\\n\\nMs Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. She said: \"We can\\'t get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence. \"That is the kind of thing we want to stop and that\\'s the kind of thing supporters\\' groups are very clear they don\\'t want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that.\"\\n\\nMs Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: \"The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. \"We have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top, who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches, to be able to stop them attending the games. \"That\\'s the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games,\" she said. Praising Celtic and Rangers for their efforts, she said: \"I don\\'t think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs. \"Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people.\"\\n',\n",

I\\'ve never done that and I have medals for sporting merit.\" Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.\\n\\nThe Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain\\'s anti-violence commission. The fine was far less than the expected amount of about Â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined Â£15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones\\' punishment was too lenient. \"You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should,\" Wenger said. \"He shouldn\\'t have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don\\'t know but it doesn\\'t look a big punishment.\" However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. \"I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete),\" said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. \"I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat.\" Spain\\'s anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA\\'s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. Aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FA\\'s disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had \"acted in a racist way.\" \"A fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment. Suspension would have been a bit exaggerated,\" Flores told sports daily Marca.\\n',\n",

More recently it was behind the Harry Potter games for the PlayStation. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers.

       " 'Losing yourself in online gaming\\n\\nOnline role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. But are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?\\n\\nWhen video game World of Warcraft hit the shops in Europe last week fans wrote in to the BBC website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. \"An addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote Travis Anderson, in Texas. Some of the comments were humorous: \"This game is so good I\\'m not going to get it, there\\'s no way I could limit the hours I\\'d spend playing it,\" wrote Charles MacIntyre, from England.\\n\\nBut some struck a more worrying tone about the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG): \"\\'You need to get out more\\' could be the motto of any MMORPG. Shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,\" wrote Stuart Stanton-Davies, in Huddersfield. Scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of Pong stopped everyone from working at the Atari offices.\\n\\nGaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.\\n\\nUnfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. However, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. And the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.\\n\\nMassively multiplayer online role playing games - MMORPGs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. The scope of these games - like Warcraft, EverQuest, Ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. Part of the \"problem\" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. Such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is EverQuest (EQ) nicknamed EverCrack. E Hayot, writing in the culture blogzine Print Culture, said recently: \"I used to play the online role-playing game EverQuest a lot. \"By \\'a lot\\', I mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where I didn\\'t have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.\"\\n\\nHe says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn\\'t that unusual; lots of people I knew in the game played EQ that much\". \"You lie; you don\\'t go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching TV (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how EverQuest took over his time. He quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than EverQuest.\\n\\nLet us be clear - such obsession is rare. But the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. Almost 400,000 people bought a copy of World of Warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. Only a fraction will descend into obsessives. The thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by EverQuest can be found on one blog EverQuest Daily Grind. Jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. \"I am actually convinced at this point that there are more than \\'some\\' people who spend more times in MMOPRGs than in reality,\" she said. One unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: \"On the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as I do, I find that I am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t talk to him while he is playing. There is absolutely no point as he doesn\\'t hear me or is so distracted that I get a \\'ummm... ya\\' a few minutes after I ask him a question.\"\\n\\n\"Gaming widows\" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. But for some it is not in the least funny. Another correspondent wrote: \"I believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\" And some of them are even sadder: \"Today our son was five days old. \"The sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his Warcraft game. He did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online.\" Video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. But as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but I think it probably isn\\'t. An 11 hour stretch isn\\'t that surprising - I\\'ve known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. I know of people who are spending their week\\'s holiday from work playing Warcraft. I know of people who would play Ever[Crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they \\'needed\\' to appear. I understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. By all standards many of us are addicts. So is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?\\n\\nSadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, I find myself longing to have the time to join them. I have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. And more and more so I find I have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.\\n\\nI think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. I play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but I don\\'t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.\\n\\nI have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. RPGs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. Unlike books, or perhaps even TV, you gain absolutely nothing. When you stop playing you\\'re at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you\\'ve gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.\\n\\nDespite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these MMORPGs is enough to hook games for hours daily. If only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. Perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?\\n\\nMy advice to gaming widows is \"if you can\\'t beat \\'em, join \\'em\". That is, try playing it yourself. If he wants to play as well, well at least you\\'ll be together somewhere...\\n\\nI was an addict and it cost me my relationship. I still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, How long have i played in one sitting? From morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. Now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and I have a girlfriend but still no job. For the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.\\n\\nObsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of \"reality\". Obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing EverQuest has a problem. This problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. An obsessive EQ player does not consider the game to be \"real\" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. If MMORPGs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. The problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.\\n\\nThe problem with these so called MMORPGS is that you can never really complete them, there\\'s always another quest to do. A few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...\\n\\nChampionship Manager consumed my life for years. One particular session started at about 2pm on a Sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the Monday and after visit to University for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. The people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. I would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.\\n\\nI used to be an EverQuest addict while I was in college. It came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. I failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. I was lucky that I came to my senses when I did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. Now that I am holding a job, I avoid online RPGS like the plague.\\n\\nWhen I was made redundant I told my partner I had a new job for three months whilst every day I played EverQuest from 7:30am till 5:pm. When She came home I pretended I had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. I have since quit playing MMORPG and have a good job.\\n\\nWhen I got to the point where I was eating my dinner in front of the PC I realised things were getting silly so I\\'m trying not to spend so much time on there. It\\'s not easy. I feel as if I\\'ve got a real addiction going on here.\\n\\nFor me the problem is that I love to complete a goal. Once it is completed that is it, I am finished, time to move on. I become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. In a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. It is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the PC game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world. Pretty scary implications if you think about it.\\n\\nI can\\'t buy World of Warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, I just know it!!\\n\\nI played Star Wars Galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. They are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. I\\'m sad to say that at the peak of my addiction I was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. Thankfully I made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my Jedi account for Â£800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.\\n\\nSeven years ago, I began playing Ultima Online. This game dominated 2 years of my life. They were 2 wonderful years and I still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends I had. Online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. Something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. Whilst I would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, I believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching TV.\\n\\nGaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. When I was single I used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. But somehow I found time to get out, even met someone and got married! Has my life changed? Hell no! I still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. On with the fun!\\n\\nOnline gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.\\n\\nMany people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. A minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. According to this article the same is true of MMORPGs. The message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!\\n\\nSounds like there are some sad stories here - and I can believe them all. I play alot of Warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. I am resolute that it will not take over my life. It certainly gets in the way though. I think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.\\n\\nI think I\\'m obsessed with gaming in general, I spend far too much time playing games like Everquest 2 and Football Manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when I do try to, I\\'m always thinking in the back if my mind that I\\'d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with Cambridge United.\\n\\nI am obsessed with online role playing games. It\\'s not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. I spend about five hours per day online playing it and I rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...\\n\\nAs many of the players spend their time in MMORPGs rather than in front of the TV I fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. Furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.\\n\\nThese games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.\\n\\nLiving in Korea at the moment, they have lots PC Bangs (Internet Cafes). Nearly most of South Koreans are addicted to online games, and one Korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\\n\\nI play xbox live every day. I find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. The longest I played was a 24 hour straight session. I know I play for to long but it\\'s an obsession that I can\\'t control. Can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something I\\'m increasingly concerned with...\\n\\nMe and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we\\'re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a TV, trying to \\'frag\\' some individual. It\\'s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying \\'real\\' life...\\n\\nI bought the US version of World of Warcraft when it came out. The longest period I played was 23 hrs straight. I gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the European version (couldn\\'t help myself). In future, I\\'m going to regulate my time far more strictly. Great game!\\n\\nHaving played MMORPG games for some years I agree that these type of games can be life sucking. But my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. Most MMORPG games you need a credit card to play but I dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.\\n\\nUnless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.\\n\\nThese people are pathetic. They need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and \"online universe\" absolutely meaningless.\\n\\n24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, Ultima Online was the game, ahhhh them was the days ! LOL\\n',\n",
       " 'Business fears over sluggish EU economy\\n\\nAs European leaders gather in Rome on Friday to sign the new EU constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.\\n\\nLille is a popular tourist destination for Britons who want a taste of France at the weekend. But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. Beck-Crespel is a specialist steel firm in Armentieres, about 20 miles from Lille. The company has not laid off a worker since 1945. It specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in Europe these days.\\n\\nDirector Hugues Charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the Far East are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in China and India. \"In our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. It isn\\'t just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. But at least there is still a steel industry. Coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. New business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.\\n\\nThat is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the University of Lille.\\n\\n\"In the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is 15%. They don\\'t see what Europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. The euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. Much of that trade passes through the world\\'s largest port, Rotterdam, in Holland, home to specialist crane maker Huisman Itrec. Its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken Russian submarine Kursk from the sea bed, but Huisman Itrec is now setting up a factory in China, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.\\n\\nBoss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. \"In the US growth is something like 6%, in China they are estimating 15%, and in the EU it is more or less 1%,\" he says. Mr Addink blames the euro for stifling demand. He much preferred the old currencies of Europe, which moved in relation to each country\\'s economic performance. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. In Britain that would be a bad year; in Germany it is one of the best in recent years. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone\\'s economy, this is a major problem. If Germany doesn\\'t once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. However, at one factory near the Dutch border things are changing.\\n\\nThe Siemens plant at Boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. Staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after Siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to Hungary. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity \"by nearly 30%\". But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. \"Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. If we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. Four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.\\n',\n",

       " 'Indonesians face fuel price rise\\n\\nIndonesia\\'s government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.\\n\\nMillions of Indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\\'s government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. Millions of people were left homeless in Indonesia Aceh\\'s region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late December.\\n\\nIndonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. It spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; Â£3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. Since President Yudhoyono\\'s government came to power in October, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"The (January to March) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, State Minister for National Development Planning. \"We are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. The sooner the better for the state budget.\" The BBC\\'s correspondent in Jakarta, Rachel Harvey, told World Business Report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"The big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. Indonesia\\'s previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK \\'risks breaking golden rule\\'\\n\\nThe UK government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests.\\n\\nThe rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) claims that taxes need to rise by about Â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. The Treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. According to NIESR, if the government\\'s current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is \"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said.\\n\\nThe report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown\\'s forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.\\n\\nIt claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. A Treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond\". \"Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.\" Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy.\\n\\nIt said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world economy will continue to grow strongly\". Global gross domestic product (GDP) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. The US will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in Japan. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone \"is expected to pick up speed\".\\n\\nGrowth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"Despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" NIESR said, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery\". GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK\\'s much analysed and fretted over property market.\\n',\n",
       " \"GSK aims to stop Aids profiteers\\n\\nOne of the world's largest manufacturers of HIV/Aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills - supplied to poorer African countries - back into Europe for resale at far higher price.\\n\\nThe company, GlaxoSmithKline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. It is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way. This is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies. They want to maintain their profits, but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti-Aids drugs to the world's poorest nations.\\n\\nThe result is that drugs supplied to Africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in Europe; bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of HIV-positive Africans through their government's health care systems.\\n\\nBut the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re-selling them at a higher price. GlaxoSmithKline believes that by coating the pills destined for Africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced. The company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in Africa who have re-sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in Europe that have also been involved in the trade. Glaxo says distribution of the new-look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in Europe.\\n\",\n",

Jurors in Virginia recommended that the man, Jeremy Jaynes, serve nine years in prison and that his sister, Jessica DeGroot, be fined $7,500. They were convicted under a state law that bars the sending of bulk e-mails using fake addresses.\\n\\nThey will be formally sentenced next year. A third defendant, Richard Rutkowski, was acquitted. Prosecutors said Jaynes was \"a snake oil salesman in a new format\", using the internet to peddle useless wares, news agency Associated Press reported. A \"Fed-Ex refund processor\" was supposed to allow people to earn $75 an hour working from home. Another item on sale was an \"internet history eraser\". His sister helped him process credit card payments. Jaynes amassed a fortune of $24m from his sales, prosecutors said. \"He\\'s been successful ripping people off all these years,\" AP quoted prosecutor Russell McGuire as saying. Jaynes was also found guilty of breaking a state law which prohibits the sending of more than 100,000 e-mails in 30 days, Virginia State Attorney General Jerry Kilgore reportedly said. Prosecutors had asked for 15 years in jail for Jaynes, and a jail term for his sister. But Jaynes\\' lawyer David Oblon called the nine-year recommended term \"outrageous\" and said his client believed he was innocent.

       " 'Jobs growth still slow in the US\\n\\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\\n\\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\\'s election.

Because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for \"personal enjoyment\" and they cannot be copied for commercial gain.\\n',\n",
       " \"Troubled Marsh under SEC scrutiny\\n\\nThe US stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker Marsh & McLennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm's shares. Marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the SEC investigation. Marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the New York attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. Since that inquiry was launched in October, Marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. Prosecutors allege that Marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other US insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. This is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by New York's top law officer, Eliot Spitzer, and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the State of California. The SEC's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the Trident Funds, managed by MMC Capital, the company's private equity firm. Marsh's new chief executive, Michael Cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with Mr Spitzer. Mr Spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate America's misdeeds.\\n\\nThe uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - to downgrade Marsh in recent weeks. According to the Financial Times, insurance analysts are now questioning whether Marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. Doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Asia shares defy post-quake gloom\\n\\nThailand has become the first of the 10 southern Asian nations battered by giant waves at the weekend to cut its economic forecast.\\n\\nThailand\\'s economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact.\\n\\nThe highs showed the gap in outlook between investors in large firms and individuals who have lost their livelihoods.\\n\\nInvestors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas - such as Aceh in Indonesia - were so under-developed that the tragedy would little impact on Asia\\'s listed companies, according to analysts. \"Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing. But it\\'s not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense,\" said ABN Amro chief Asian strategist Eddie Wong. India\\'s Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka\\'s stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.\\n\\nThailand may lose 30bn baht (Â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.\\n\\nIn the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry\\'s fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.\\n',\n",
       " 'More women turn to net security\\n\\nOlder people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study.\\n\\nThe number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.\\n\\nThe study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005. They could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. \"I think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their PCs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong\", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research.\\n\\n\"You started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years,\" Paul Goosens, head of Preventon told the BBC News website. \"Now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home.\" But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.\\n\\nPrograms also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said Mr Goosens. Security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. The nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. High-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. Without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally.\\n\\nMore than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. Programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in Eastern Europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. The research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said Mr Goosens, they are reported in the press much more. \"You are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. They are asking the right questions,\" he explained. \"It is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net.\" An unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access. In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics.\\n',\n",
       " 'Napster offers rented music to go\\n\\nMusic downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.\\n\\nThe cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.\\n\\n\"Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,\" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative.\\n\\nCurrently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.\\n\\nThis has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers \"greater value\" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. \"We\\'ve been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,\" he said. \"Who wants to download a track that won\\'t play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?\" Wippit offers a download subscription service for Â£4.99 per month or Â£50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs.\\n',\n",

They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven\\'t even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I\\'m going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore\\'s part. I haven\\'t been approached and I wouldn\\'t take it anyway.\"\\n\\nHe said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don\\'t want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn\\'t be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Why few targets are better than many\\n\\nThe economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world\\'s leading economy by 2010.\\n\\nBut the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe doesn\\'t become a global economic laggard. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. That\\'s why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on Wednesday, by the former Dutch prime minister Wim Kok. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. His conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.\\n\\nLisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"The status quo is not an option.\"\\n\\nAt risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society Europe has built, it said. The report comes at a time when Europe\\'s competitive position is waning. The EU\\'s economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. That has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.\\n\\nAs Mr Kok\\'s report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"\\n\\nThe circumstances weren\\'t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. Neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the EU was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group. \"What you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers\\' associations. \"Even though they tell you they\\'re in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"\\n\\nBut part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago. Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report. Economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\\n\\n\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said. \"Everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" That\\'s why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. It also recommends that the European Commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they\\'re taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"Rhetoric and delivery don\\'t necessarily go hand in hand,\" Mr Kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"We don\\'t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"\\n\\nOn one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"It\\'s very ambitious,\" said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. \"This is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. It\\'s going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn\\'t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. For example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. But it doesn\\'t say how companies should be convinced to do this. It will be up to the incoming president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, to adopt Mr Kok\\'s recommendations and press them on EU governments. Mr Barroso has said that the EU\\'s competitiveness will be his top priority. He expects his five-year term in office to be judged on Europe\\'s success in meeting the Lisbon agenda.\\n',\n",
       " 'Anti-spam laws bite spammer hard\\n\\nThe net\\'s self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nScott Richter, the man behind OptInRealBig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into Chapter 11. OptInRealBig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against Microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. The company said filing for Chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading.\\n\\nListed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog Spamhaus, OptInRealBig was sued in December 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. The lawsuit was brought by Microsoft and New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who alleged that Mr Richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries. According to Microsoft the messages were sent via net addresses owned by the Kuwait Ministries of Communication and Finance, several Korean schools, the Seoul Municipal Boramae Hospital, and the Virginia Community College System. Mr Richter settled the attorney general case in July 2004 but the legal fight with Microsoft is continuing. Microsoft is seeking millions in dollars in damages from OptInRealBig under anti-spam laws that impose penalties for every violation. In a statement announcing the desire to seek bankruptcy protection the company said it: \"could not continue to contend with legal maneuvers (sic) by a number of companies across the country, including Microsoft, and still run a viable business.\" In its Chapter 11 filing OptInRealBig claimed it had assets of less than $10m (Â£5.29m) but debts of more than $50m which included the $46m that Microsoft is seeking via its lawsuit. \"The litigation has been a relentless distraction with which to contend,\" said Steven Richter, legal counsel for OptInRealBig. \"But, make no mistake, we do expect to prevail.\" For its part OptInRealBig describes itself as a premier internet marketing company and said the move to seek Chapter 11 was necessary to let it keep trading while sorting out its legal battles.\\n',\n",
       " 'Final hunts held as ban looms\\n\\nHunts in England and Wales have begun on the last day that hunting with dogs is legal, with more due out later.\\n\\nThousands of supporters are expected to turn out at more than 250 meets, many of which have altered their normal schedules to be out on a Thursday. The ban on hunting with dogs comes into effect from 0001 GMT on Friday. The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.\\n\\nBut the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.\\n\\nAnti-hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, told BBC News: \"We\\'ve long urged them to go drag hunting - to follow an artificial scent - and that is what we hope they do. \"But if they continue to chase foxes, to chase wild mammals around the countryside, that\\'s against the law and we\\'re confident they\\'ll be brought to justice.\" At the headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt. BBC correspondent Sarah Mukherjee said hunt supporters were in tears.\\n\\nShe said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance\\'s optimism that hunting would be able to continue. Farmer Geoff Brooks, a senior member of the Quorn hunt, told BBC News people\\'s lives \"revolved around hunting\". He described the ban as \"ridiculous\" and \"badly thought out\" but said it would be hard for most people to defy it as they would not want to risk their incomes by getting a criminal record.\\n\\nAt the Court of Appeal on Wednesday, the Countryside Alliance failed in its attempt to have the Hunting Act ruled invalid. But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.\\n\\nThe alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday. The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions. The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on how to deal with the new rules. A spokesman said: \"Basically, it\\'s not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.\" The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected. He said police would consider evidence submitted by anti-hunt organisations on its merits.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lords wrong on detainees - Straw\\n\\nJack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain\\'s highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.\\n\\nThe foreign secretary said the right to life was the \"most important liberty\" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\\n\\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government\\'s anti-terror policy.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government\\'s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords\\' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\\n\\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke\\'s first day as home secretary following David Blunkett\\'s resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\\n\\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office\\'s powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee \\'A\\' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal \\'law\\' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\\n',\n",

About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\\n\\nThe thrust of this year\\'s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\\n\\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple\\'s iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\\n\\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft\\'s Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.\\n',\n",

And Bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena. The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year. Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February.

Athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can, and I would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition. Mind you, every time she breaks the record she gets $30,000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it. World records aside, I thought it was a very encouraging evening's work for Kelly Holmes. She looked good and was very positive. Agnes Samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. Yes, Samaria let Kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as Kelly dominated the race, so beating Samaria is a bit of a benchmark for Kelly. My gut feeling is that Kelly would like to run in the European Indoor Championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so. On the other hand, I think Jason Gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in Madrid. He started well in the final but still could not stay with the front-runners. Jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.\\n\\nIt would have been nice to see what Mark Lewis-Francis could have done in the final, if only he hadn't got himself disqualified. He was blatantly playing the false-start game to his advantage, but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly. My view is you're meant to go when the gun goes and not before. And if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false-start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again. Having said that, Mark is looking in much better shape. But I haven't seen anything from Mark or Jason yet which suggests France's Ronald Pognon - who has run 6.45 seconds - will be under threat at the Europeans. From a British point of view, Sarah Claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.\\n\\nSomething else that probably went unnoticed was Melanie Purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds. AAAs champion Kim Wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the European Championships. Scotland's Lee McConnell is probably going to run too, so we have a real prospect of a medal. From an international perspective, I thought Meseret Defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but I don't think the pace-making was great. Canadian Heather Hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if Jo Pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given Defar a real run for her money. She had a go but just could not hang in there. We were also expecting a bit more from Bernard Lagat in the men's 1500m. But he has only just come over from the USA, so he may not be that sharp and I still think he is in great shape. As for Kenenisa Bekele, he was well beaten by Markos Geneti. But we only had half expectations for Bekele as he has been struggling this season. It was very hot in the National Indoor Arena and I felt uncomfortable in the commentary box. I think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact Defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.\\n\",\n",

       " 'US data sparks inflation worries\\n\\nWholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.\\n\\nNew figures show the Labor Department producer price index (PPI) rose by 0.3% - in line with forecasts. But core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since December 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. In contrast, the University of Michigan barometer of US retail consumer confidence showed a slight dip. The university\\'s index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public. The mixed set of data on Friday led to volatile early Wall Street trade, as the Dow Jones, Standard and Poor\\'s 500, and Nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory.\\n\\nThe economic figures come on the back of increased fears that the Federal Reserve chairman may be about to raise interest rates in order to stifle any inflationary pressures. The Fed has been raising interest rates at a gradual pace since June 2004, in an attempt to make sure inflation does not get out of control.\\n\\nMr Greenspan told Congress this week that the central bank was on guard against the possibility that a rebounding economy could trigger stronger inflation pressures. \"The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace,\" said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management. \"But this Michigan survey tells you that the consumer might be downshifting a little bit in terms of their confidence and their spending; this could be an indication of that.\"\\n\\nConsumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed. However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years. \"The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates,\" said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor\\'s. But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was \"much less alarming\" than at first glance. One-time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which \"are no indication of broad PPI pressure\", were responsible for the increase, he said. Prices for autos and trucks also jumped in January, but Shepherdson said \"it is a good bet these increases won\\'t stick\".\\n',\n",

It claims this was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a \"great thriller\" but \"lousy history\". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown\\'s conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.\\n\\nWriting his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: \"Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. \"Dan Brown is the best writer I\\'ve come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable.\" A great deal of credible evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus\\' life was true, according to the Bishop. \"The evidence for Jesus and the origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,\" he said. \"We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.\\n\\n\"Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don\\'t fit the world of later legend.\" Brown\\'s book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims.

       " \"Scotland 18-10 Italy\\n\\nSix Chris Paterson penalties gave Scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.\\n\\nCoach Matt Williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and Scotland were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. Scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.\\n\\nA series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. Scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. Scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.\\n\\nAs the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with Scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy's De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And Scotland capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.\\n\\nWith the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan's men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross' attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Webster, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; S Taylor, J Petrie, A Hogg.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, C Stoica, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni; S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt); A Persico, D Dal Maso, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, S Orlando, P Griffen, R Pedrazzi, KP Robertson.\\n\",\n",

The book, Brown\\'s Britain, said Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters\\' trust.\\n\\nThe author\\'s sources, all unnamed \"allies\" of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, said the prime minister felt the Iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party.\\n\\nThe book, serialised in the Sunday Telegraph, alleges that Mr Blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy PM John Prescott in November 2003 of his intention to stand down. \"At that stage he saw Gordon Brown and said, \\'look you are the next most influential member of the government, I need your help to get through the next year,\" Mr Peston said. \"I myself recognise that I\\'m going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\\'\" But he changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims.\\n\\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private I don\\'t think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" There has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami.

       " \"Europe backs digital TV lifestyle\\n\\nHow people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project.\\n\\nIn Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\\n\\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.\\n\\nSimon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media\\n\",\n",

The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"It won\\'t be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,\" he said. \"In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this.

Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.\\n\\nHowever, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. \"The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Defection timed to hit tax pledge\\n\\nWith impeccable and precisely-calculated timing, Tory defector Robert Jackson and his new Labour bosses have attempted to overshadow Michael Howard\\'s latest announcement on taxation and spending.\\n\\nWith just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election, Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories\\' resolutely depressing poll showings. The big idea is his Â£35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts. And it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost programme. He and his shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now, but without any concrete pledges. But Mr Howard announced that, of the Â£35bn he has earmarked from savings, Â£12bn will be used to plug Labour\\'s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in Mr Letwin\\'s first budget. He would not be precise, but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax. But he did, for the first time, say there would be such tax cuts.\\n\\n\"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less\". It is the Tories\\' attempt to open that famed \"clear blue water\" between them and the Labour party and return to a traditional Tory agenda that will both reassure the middle England voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core Conservative voters. So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact. Mr Howard, however, was dismissive. \"These things happen from time to time. There are disagreements between Robert Jackson and me.\\n\\n\"The election is not going to be decided on what Robert Jackson did,\" he added. And that is certainly true. The election will be decided on \"the economy stupid\". Other issues like the Iraq war and the \"trust\" thing will also play a major part. But it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote. And many on the Tory benches have been crying out for Mr Howard to get back onto the old Tory tax cuts agenda. Mr Howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first. With polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts, he has suggested that is exactly what he will do. Whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen.\\n',\n",

That in turn paved the way for John Major to move into 10 Downing Street, after the second ballot. Meyer\\'s constituency party, Clwyd North West, which he had represented as an MP for more than 20 years, deselected him as a result of that challenge. Sir Anthony John Charles Meyer was born on 27 October, 1920. Educated at Eton, and at New College, Oxford, he served in the Scots Guards from 1941 to 1945 and was wounded in tanks in Normandy. He worked under Edward Heath on Europe at the Foreign Office and subsequently won the Eton and Slough seat for the Tories in 1964 - by 11 votes. Labour regained the seat two years later, and Meyer had to wait until 1970 before he could re-enter Parliament. His prospects of a front bench slot remained remote because he tended to defy the party line.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mobiles rack up 20 years of use\\n\\nMobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.\\n\\nBritain\\'s first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.\\n\\nThe first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine\\'s dock to Vodafone\\'s head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.\\n\\n\"Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,\" he said. \"They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.\" This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. \"It\\'s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,\" he said. \"Cellnet was forecasting half that.\" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.\\n',\n",

       " 'Movie body hits peer-to-peer nets\\n\\nThe movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the US.\\n\\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called LokiTorrent closed down. It is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called BitTorrent to be hit by the MPAA. The MPAA began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in December. A Dallas court agreed that Hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to LokiTorrent\\'s server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. In October 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files. The action came after the operators of LokiTorrent agreed a settlement with the MPAA. A stark message has appeared on the site from the MPAA warning \"You can click, but you can\\'t hide\". In BitTorrent systems, server sites do not host the files being shared. They host links, called \"trackers\" that direct people to others that have it instead.\\n\\nAs well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the US, the MPAA said it had given operators that host eDonkey servers \"take down\" notices. Hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and TV programmes then share the files online. But it is now targeting the operators of BitTorrent networks themselves. It has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of BitTorrent server sites since December. The strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers\\' ability to swap content using BitTorrent systems. The film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and DVDs already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. In December, the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. The popular Suprnova.org website was forced to close, and others like Phoenix Torrent followed soon after.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hollywood to sue net film pirates\\n\\nThe US movie industry has launched legal action to sue people who facilitate illegal film downloading.\\n\\nThe Motion Picture Association of America wants to stop people using the program BitTorrent to swap movies. The industry is targeting people who run websites which provide information and internet links to movies which have been copied or filmed in cinemas. More than 100 server operators have been targeted in the actions launched in the US and UK, the MPAA added. The suits were filed against users of the file-sharing programs BitTorrent, eDonkey and DirectConnect in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Finland and the Netherlands, the MPAA said.\\n\\nBitTorrent users can download movies by following a link to files which are found on websites called trackers. Unlike most peer-to-peer programs BitTorrent works by sharing a file, which could be anything from a legitimate digital photo to a copied movie, among multiple users at the same time. The movie industry hopes that suing the people who run the trackers will cut BitTorrent users off from illegal movies at source. Last month major film studios started legal action against 200 individuals who were swapping films online. The growth in broadband has made it quicker for people to download movies and the industry fears that if it does not take action now, it could suffer the same downturn as the music industry.\\n',\n",

Its withdrawal from the $325m (Â£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said \"the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner\". But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. \"Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,\" it said in a statement. The Pentagon\\'s Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack\\'s management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.\\n\\nUS firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack\\'s withdrawal from the transportation contract was a \"mutually agreed-to separation\" and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. \"Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,\" he added. \"Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.\"\\n',\n",

He said the current level of taxation was about right, although he would put a new 50% tax on top earners. Other parties have accused the Lib Dems of making uncosted promises. Mr Kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation. The Lib Dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and Wednesday\\'s speech did not announce new policies.\\n\\nSpeaking at the Commonwealth Club, Mr Kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility, both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver. He said. \"Budgets have to add up. Tough choices are needed in public spending.\" The Lib Dems would cut \"low priority\" spending, including the government\\'s ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund.\\n\\nThose cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over-75s, putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks, he said. The Lib Dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax. Now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down. There would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the \"polluter who pays\".\\n\\nThe Lib Dems say the Tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while Labour has hidden most of its tax rises. Mr Kennedy said: \"That contract with the people - that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely - can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans. \"With the stealth tax strategy of Gordon Brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system - especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the Conservative party on this issue - it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.\" He challenged the Treasury to open up its books so the National Audit Office can report on the government\\'s performance.\\n\\nConservative co-chairman Liam Fox said: Liam Fox said \"If Charles Kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments. \"The reality is, the Lib Dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy, and the only people who would face \\'tough choices\\' would be the families who would be Â£630 worse off a year. \" And Chancellor Gordon Brown said the Lib Dem figures did not add up. He accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more.\\n',\n",

Chief police officers spokesman Nigel Yeo said he expected most people would obey the law - by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them. He said police would challenge the \"one of two isolated hunts\" which are threatening to break the law.\\n\\nBut Simon Hart of the Countryside Alliance has questioned how police will ensure there are no violations. \"The definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements. \"You can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law. He said he will consult the Director of Public Prosecutions and the police \"in the near future\" to decide what measures to take with regards to hunting prosecutions. He has rejected a \"blanket policy\" of not enforcing the ban until the House of Lords has considered its legality. John Cooper, a barrister and chairman of the League Against Cruel Sports, said the anti-hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. He said police had \"acknowledged their duty to investigate allegations of hunting offences\".\\n\\nThe Beaufort Hunt had one pack out on Thursday and has promised a hunt this weekend. Under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.\\n\\nAs well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to \"flush out\" foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them. \"We are not going away.

But Tony Banks, Labour MP for West Ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that \"people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about\". He said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. \"Let the election decide this because the Conservatives have made clear that if they get elected into government they will restore hunting,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Tuesday\\'s figures represent the first time that the unemployment rate has fallen to a single digit since new measurement rules were introduced in 2001. The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since April 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%. The jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the IBGE said.\\n\\nThis improvement can be attributed to the country\\'s strong economic growth, with the economy registering growth of 5.2% in 2004, the government said. The economy is expected to grow by about 4% this year. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva promised to reduce unemployment when he was elected two years ago. Nevertheless, some analysts say that unemployment could increase in the next months. \"The data is favourable, but a lot of jobs are temporary for the (Christmas) holiday season, so we may see slightly higher joblessness in January and February,\" Julio Hegedus, chief economist with Lopes Filho & Associates consultancy in Rio de Janeir, told Reuters news agency. Despite his leftist background, President Lula has pursued a surprisingly conservative economic policy, arguing that in order to meet its social promises, the government needs to first reach a sustained economic growth. The unemployment rate is measured in the six main metropolitan areas of Brazil (Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Recife, Salvador and Porto Alegre), where most of the population is concentrated.\\n',\n",

Over the next few months I will spend time listening to those who already make a significant contribution to athletics and other elite sports in the UK.\" Collins, who has worked with javelin thrower Steve Backley in the past, started his career as a Royal Marine before becoming a PE teacher. He is currently professor of physical education and sport performance at Edinburgh University, where he helps competitors across many sports, including rugby, athletics, judo and football.\\n\\nHe has specialised in helping competitors fulfil their potential through psychology and has worked with the Great Britain women\\'s curling team, who won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mark Lewis-Francis sought Collins\\' advice in Athens when he was looking for inspiration before he ran the final leg of Britain\\'s surprise triumph in the 4x100m relay. Collins has played rugby at regional level, was captain of the Great Britain American Football team, and competed at national level in judo and karate. He arrives with British athletics at a crossroads. Despite Kelly Holmes\\' golden double and the success of the sprint relay squad, the GB team failed to live up to expectations in Athens. Many older competitors have retired or are coming to the end of their careers, and Britain failed to win a single medal at the world junior championships in Italy this year. Collins will not have day-to-day coaching contact with the athletes, but will be expected to make changes to the system and coaching set-up in order to secure medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. The appointment of a new performance director was one of the main recommendations in Sir Andrew Foster\\'s review of the sport, which was published in May. It was commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, which wanted UK Athletics to justify funding of more than Â£40m from the Government following the failure to hang on to the 2005 World Championships, which are now being held in Helsinki. Van Commenee dropped out of the selection process to take on the same role with the Dutch Olympic Committee, while Connor\\'s application was rejected after an arduous interview process. Foster, however, declared himself satisfied with how the appointment was made. \"The appointment of David Collins, with his strong mix of leadership skills and managerial experience, is testament to the professional and detailed recruitment process,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " \"Teens 'know little' of politics\\n\\nTeenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge.\\n\\nOnly a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that Labour was the government, the Tories were the official Opposition and the Lib Dems were the third party. Almost all could identify Tony Blair, but only one in six knew who Michael Howard was, and just one in 10 recognised Charles Kennedy. The ICM survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog Ofsted. Nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for. And 4% of those questioned thought the Conservatives were in power - while 2% of them believed the Lib Dems were. The survey also looked at issues of nationality. It found the Union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being British. Many of the pupils also looked on themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh, rather than British; while the notion of being European hardly occurred to anyone.\\n\",\n",

May said: \"Suddenly the Queen Phoenix is rising again from the ashes and will take precedence over... our lives.\" Queen have played with many different singers since Mercury\\'s death in 1991 but have reportedly not toured. May performed with Rodgers at a concert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar in London in September.\\n\\n\"We were both so amazed at the chemistry that was going on in [Free hit] All Right Now, that suddenly it seems blindingly obvious that there was \\'something happening here,\\'\" May wrote on his website. They teamed up again for a concert to mark their induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame, and were joined by Taylor. \"The show went so incredibly well from our point of view, and we got so many rave reactions from out there, we decided almost then and there that we would look at a tour together,\" May wrote.\\n\\nQueen went to number one in 2000 with a version of We Will Rock You sung by boy band 5ive and they have also played with Robbie Williams, Will Young and Bob Geldof. Queen bassist John Deacon has currently retired from the stage. Rodgers was singer with early 1970s rockers Free, who had a global hit with All Right Now, before forming Bad Company, a successful \"supergroup\" with members of King Crimson and Mott the Hoople.

       " 'Guantanamo man \\'suing government\\'\\n\\nA British terror suspect held in Guantanamo Bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.\\n\\nMartin Mubanga claimed in the Observer that an MI6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the US camp in Cuba, following his arrest in Zambia. Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. The home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not \"well informed\". Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.\\n\\nHe said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002. Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam. But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead. Mr Mubanga said the \"MI6 agent\" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission. Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.\\n\\nHis lawyer Louise Christian said: \"\\'We are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the Americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to Guantanamo.\" And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats\\' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga\\'s transfer to Guantanamo. But a Foreign Office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of British intelligence or security agencies. And Home Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost: \"I\\'m not organising a specific investigation into it.\" Mr Mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. He told the Observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last March, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.\\n\\nHe claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: \"I\\'ve lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim. He added: \"The authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. They\\'ve made me what I am - even if I\\'m not quite sure yet who that person is.\" The US government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. In a statement, it said: \"The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. \"He was detained to prevent him from fighting against the US and our allies in the war on terror.\" But Fair Trials Abroad director Stephen Jakobi said there were similarities between Mr Mubanga\\'s account and those of other Guantanamo detainees. He said: \"The pattern is the same. The real problem is the concentration camp conditions in Guantanamo. \"Is [Charles Clarke] really pretending this is all made up?\" Mr Mubanga and the three other freed British detainees were released without charge by UK police on their return from Cuba.\\n',\n",
       " 'Jobs growth still slow in the US\\n\\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\\n\\nAccording to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November\\'s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year\\'s election. However, when adding December and January\\'s figures, the administration\\'s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.\\n\\nThe Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.\\n\\nAnalysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. \"We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. \"That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\\n',\n",

Lucas predicted the film would get a US rating advising parents some scenes may be unsuitable for under-13s. It opens in the UK and US on 19 May. He said he expected the film would be classified PG-13 - roughly equivalent to a British 12A rating.\\n\\nThe five previous Star Wars films have all carried less restrictive PG - parental guidance - ratings in the US. In the UK, they have all been passed U - suitable for all - with the exception of Attack of The Clones, which got a PG rating in 2002. Revenge of the Sith - the third prequel to the original 1977 Star Wars film - chronicles the transformation of the heroic Anakin Skywalker into the evil Darth Vader as he travels to a Hell-like planet composed of erupting volcanoes and molten lava. \"We\\'re going to watch him make a pact with the devil,\" Lucas said. \"The film is much more dark, more emotional. It\\'s much more of a tragedy.\"\\n',\n",

Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters\\' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers.\\n\\nMr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world\\'s \"genuine refugees\".\\n\\n\"The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution,\" he was due to say. \"But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system. \"Fair play matters. People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,\" he said. \"And let\\'s be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain\\'s generosity.\" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party\\'s plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas.\\n\\nThat prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. \"If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,\" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. \"If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard\\'s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. \"When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. \"We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much.\"\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. On Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\"\\n',\n",

The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promises very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight.\\n\\nThe current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\\n\\nThose studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Corbett attacks \\'dumbed-down TV\\'\\n\\nRonnie Corbett has joined fellow comedy stars Victoria Wood and David Jason in attacking the declining standards of British television programmes.\\n\\nSpeaking to the Radio Times, the Two Ronnies star said there is too much bad language and reality TV. \"You get fed up watching shows with not much care and love,\" he complained. Corbett, soon to reunite with Ronnie Barker for a new Two Ronnies series, also criticised quiz shows like the BBC\\'s They Think It\\'s All Over. \"It\\'s just laughing at each other and thinking, \\'Aren\\'t we clever?\\'\" said the 74-year-old comedian. Corbett is the latest comedy star to bemoan the \"dumbing down\" of modern TV programmes. In an interview published in the Radio Times in January, Victoria Wood slated comedian Sacha Baron Cohen for his character Ali G\\'s \"horrible\" brand of \"victim\" humour.\\n\\n\"With so many good writers and good performers, it\\'s a shame people can\\'t just write a script and have other people learn it,\" she said. And last week Only Fools and Horses star David Jason criticised British TV for being \"too safe and too cheap\". \"We\\'ve got to be careful not to dumb down for the audience,\" he said. \"They shouldn\\'t be sitting at home on the sofa vegetating.\" Corbett said he and Barker were always mindful of their family audience while making The Two Ronnies. \"Our material was good-natured,\" he said. \"We knew what would upset the average man in the street. \"There\\'s a lot of swearing on TV today. They even have documentaries with the f-word.\"\\n\\nCorbett goes on to criticise \"reality programmes where they put people in a house for a fortnight and film them doing everything\". The Two Ronnies ran from 1971 to 1987 and attracted 17 million viewers at its peak. Its bespectacled stars will return later this year in The Two Ronnies Sketchbook, which will combine classic sketches with newly recorded material. Corbett claims he and Barker differ from today\\'s celebrities in that they did not allow their success to go to their heads. \"We were never temperamental, fractious or walked out slamming doors,\" he said. \"We were fussy though,\" he added. \"We wanted everything done properly.\"\\n',\n",

The original size of Libya\\'s funds was $400m, the central bank told Reuters. However, the withdrawal did not mean that Libya had cut its ties with the US, he added.\\n\\n\"We are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the United States,\" the central bank\\'s vice president Farhat Omar Ben Gadaravice said. The previously frozen assets had been invested in various countries and are believed to have included equity holdings in banks. The US ban on trade and economic activity with Tripoli - imposed by then president Ronald Regan in 1986 after a series of what the US deemed terrorist acts, including the 1988 Lockerbie air crash - was suspended in April.

BT Retail has announced that it will trial the same speed service, with a national rollout by year end. Other service providers are expected to follow suit and a glut of new voice and video services will follow.\\n\\n\"If the bandwidth is there then ISPs will buy it,\" said Jill Finger, a research director at analyst firm IDC. Others will be watching BT Retail\\'s trials, which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers, with interest. For BT Retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players. \"It has been losing market share and this could be one way of gaining some of that back,\" said Ms Finger. Wanadoo is set to trial an 8Mbps service in the summer and also plans to roll out unbundled services - which means it takes over the network from BT - which will provide speeds of up to 15Mbps. There is no timetable for this at the moment. Cable firms ntl and Telewest are also bound to increase bandwidth at some time in the future and, according to an ntl spokesman, are in a better position than BT in the long term. \"BT\\'s network is limited compared to that of cable.

       " 'Terror powers expose \\'tyranny\\'\\n\\nThe Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn\\'t enough evidence to put them on trial.\\n\\nLord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties. But thriller writer Frederick Forsyth tells BBC News of his personal response to the move.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of Britain. Or so says Home Secretary Charles Clarke. My reaction? So what? It is not that I am cynical or just do not care. I care about this country very much.\\n\\nBut in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us. My point is, the British have always coped without becoming a dictatorship. We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat. But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.\\n\\nI was born on 25 August, 1938. The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler. A week after my first birthday, the threat had become reality. We were at war. My father wore a uniform for five years. After 1945 we yearned for peace at last. But in 1946 Winston Churchill told us - from the Baltic to the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across Europe. Behind the Iron Curtain, another genocidal psychopath, another threat. Josef Stalin triggered the Cold War, with the Berlin blockade in 1948. My whole generation was blighted by it.\\n\\nWe were threatened by the nuclear holocaust, the nuclear wind, the nuclear winter. We built shelters that would have sheltered nothing. We spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals. We took silly precautions. Some fought it; some marched futilely against it. Some pretended it was not there. The Cold War lasted 43 years, but we remained a parliamentary democracy. By the early seventies it was terrorism as well. Al Fatah, Black September, Red Brigades, but most of all for us the IRA and the INLA. Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny. That was why the tyrants lost. Civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible. Evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources; yes , and one judge, no-jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised. Informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle. But habeas corpus did not die; right of appeal was not abolished. Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism. Its leaders want to destroy our society; so did the IRA.\\n\\nIt is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA. It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA. It is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents; so was the IRA. The prime movers are not easy to bring to trial; neither were the IRA. But we did. And without becoming a tyranny. Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism. The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister. To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny. But a tyranny is based on the citizen\\'s terror. This is not victory; this is defeat before a shot is fired.\\n\\nAn interesting article - its good to see widening participation in the debate - but I suggest we move one step further. Our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and \\'hunting\\' in the \\'shadows\\' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart. Rather than focusing upon effect, we should consider the cause, because terrorism does not begin with bombs. Why not try a foreign policy of compassion, it can only enhance our democracy, and share our freedom.\\n\\nI agree with Frederick Forsyth. We really can\\'t deal with terrorism by turning Britain into a fascist state. What we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians. If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn\\'t any. Our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain gets away. Remember there were no WMD in Iraq. Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.\\n\\nIn this overly \\'politically correct\\' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out. Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc. (apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?). When ID cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the Data Protection Act, and will be readily available to people like GCHQ, with no control by the person whose ID is being checked.\\n\\nThe threat now is new. You cannot compare the threats of past years with now. Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001. The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology. A Kilo of Semtex will flatten a building, a Kilo of plutonium will flatten a city. You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible. I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.\\n\\nThe problem with this issue is not that it isn\\'t important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no. However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.\\n\\nAs somebody of Chinese origin, I can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life. Whilst life wasn\\'t perfect, we could make better for ourselves. Now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do. We have to be politically-correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions. We have a Prime Minister who spends too much time meddling in US politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of British Citizens at home or abroad. Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions. Let\\'s hope the BBC doesn\\'t get gagged for letting people express their views. The people have the right to know and the BBC\\'s role is to Inform, Educate and Entertain...\\n\\nI agree. Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties. In the end, the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy. The terrorists have already won.\\n\\nI absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth. Yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate. The idea that the \"new terrorism\" demands new powers is erroneous. The evidence of any real terrorist capability in the UK is scant. Ricin, for example, is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction. What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.\\n\\nIf the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not. We will have lost the precious freedom which Bush and Blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others.\\n\\nI agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court. That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they \"knew best\".\\n\\nWhen you look at today\\'s Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.\\n\\nFrederick Forsyth puts it beautifully. The government is seeking to introduce a police state. The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years. We are sleep-walking into this. Wake up!\\n\\nAn interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance. These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence. 2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it. Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses. It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked. We won\\'t have much of a society left to debate !\\n\\nHe\\'s correct in most of what he says. Mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in Northern Ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young Catholics to join the IRA. Administrative detention of Muslims could have a similar effect now.\\n\\nSurely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.\\n\\nI don\\'t usually have much time for Mr Forsyth\\'s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on. There is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the U.K. but it is very doubtful whether al-Qaeda is a global organisation co-ordinating this. The rise of surveillance cameras, ID cards, the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times, this is the stuff of nightmares. Add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the Home Secretary, and I genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit. Where will this end. As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it\\'s government will soon have it\\'s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.\\n\\nMr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise. Thank you.\\n\\nMr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides. He also forgets basic Human Rights were suspended then as now. Experienced Judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times. For very little return and maximum alienation. These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.\\n\\nForsyth is wrong. The nature of the current threat is new. It is no longer to our armed forces, as the Soviet threat in the Eastern bloc was. It is to you and I. The terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately. The best comparison is therefore the blitz, 1941. At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public. We must not forget we are at war.\\n\\nI\\'d say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major UK target is a \"When\" not an \"If\" probability. I\\'ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn\\'t do enough to protect the UK. People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.\\n\\nI agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth. The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government. The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the \\'alleged\\' terrorists are doing, but from our own government. I believe what this government is doing, is, at the very least, highly questionable and at worst, sinister. At what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the British Isles; when we are all tagged and monitored constantly? Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing. It should be of great concern to everyone.\\n\\nI am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him. I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one. I think that the attack on Iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.\\n\\nHow true. There are extremely worrying parallels between Britain now and Germany during the 30\\'s. I never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within.\\n\\nMr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed. As a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not. That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort. But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today\\'s terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently. Let us hope not.\\n\\nFrederic Forsythe\\'s comments seem to me to be a well-thought-out analysis of why we (human society as a whole, and Britain in particular) should resist the temptation to over-protect through fear. It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe\\'s opening comments suggest.\\n\\nI am reminded of a quote attributed to Thomas Jefferson. \"A nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither.\"\\n\\nThe government are faced with an incredibly difficult task, and have made a policy to deal with it. It\\'s all very well criticising that policy, but if Mr Forsythe can\\'t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative, I say \\'So what?\\' to his opinions.\\n\\nFrederick Forsyth\\'s rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable. He distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against New Labour. This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights. It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.\\n\\nI rarely find myself agreeing with My Forsyth, but in this instance I think he is correct. The rule of law must prevail, civil liberties are worth defending. If the government can hold \\'suspects\\' without charge or trial, what\\'s next?\\n\\nI agree absolutely. By introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror. Our democratic system is not perfect, but as Churchill points out it is \"better than all the others that have been tried\". Terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.\\n\\nI do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here. The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose. Totalitarianism always requires an outside threat, justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want. The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.\\n\\nAlthough, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people. The IRA wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement.\\n\\nYes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth\\'s views. I do not believe the government\\'s plans are justified. There is over reaction to and the negative influence of the US President\\'s interpretation of democracy and freedom. He uses the same arguments that were current before the WWII, the Wars to \"liberate\" Iraq, Afghanistan with Syria and Iran to come. We are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations.\\n\\nMr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs. The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests. Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the \\'scruffy little Austrian.\\'\\n\\nThomas Hobbes would be smiling in his grave at Labour\\'s propositions. Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian. Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people\\'s best interests. But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians. Simply put, he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty - the liberty to live - man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign, as protection against his fellow, barbaric, man. Hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity, and rightly so. I hope New Labour suffers the same treatment.\\n\\nI agree with Mr Forsyth\\'s views. The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy. They must not be allowed to get away with it.\\n\\nOf course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he\\'s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny. Has he forgotten about shoot to kill, torture, internment without trial, collusion with loyalist death squads etc?\\n\\nMy background is somewhat similar to Freddie\\'s so I am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments. We can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.\\n\\nWhilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive, it is, unfortunately, also the first step towards totalitarianism. Who is to decide whom is a suspect? Why should we believe them? Who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years? What is to stop false denunciations? What of those falsely accused who will lose their careers? Who will support their families? Will their children still go to school? It smacks to me of the methods of Nazi Germany, Stalin\\'s Russia, Ceausescu\\'s Romania - the list goes on. It looks as if a new dark age is coming.\\n\\nI see that opinion on Mr Forsyth\\'s remarks are divided. The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don\\'t like or are scared of. But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power. After all, today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you! And that day, you\\'ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice. Our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces, you have to be shown to be deserving of it. If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.\\n\\nI never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I\\'m in wholehearted agreement with him on this one. We, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro US propaganda, which of course also means we\\'ll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried & tested back door methods. I grieve for the future of my children, it\\'s no wonder they\\'re adamant they don\\'t ever want any of their own.\\n\\nThis government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial. This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.\\n\\nLike many of your respondents, I wouldn\\'t usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark\\'s proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/\\n\\nI agree with Mr Forsyth. Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it\\'s case based on fear. The facts turned out to be very different. If individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we\\'ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs. We become animals too.\\n\\nI agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order. Mr Forsyth links \"Islamic fundamentalism\" to the new \"threat\". However it appears that he has misunderstood the term \"Islamic fundamentalism\". It should be pointed out that a Muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the Qur\\'aan and the teachings of the last Prophet Muhammad is an Islamic Fundamentalist. This person does not commit suicide in any shape or form, nor does she/he kill innocent women, men and children. This person is self-reflective and constantly tries to better her/his actions by being good to others. The people who Mr Forsyth labels the new \"threat\" are those who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam. They have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions. On top of that, they claim to be following Islam in its true form!\\n\\nI accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn\\'t achieve anything - the bombings didn\\'t stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.\\n\\nBeing eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on. During the IRA bombings there were massive explosions in Canary Wharf, to the right of where I write this, and also to the left in the City of London. Notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on Prime Minister Thatcher in Brighton and on later occupants of 10 Downing Street, there was no retaliatory blitz on Belfast or Dublin as there has been on Afghanistan and Iraq. Even when England was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like. We have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including ID cards, which Winston Churchill decided had to go since, he said, the average Bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities (incidentally I can still remember my old ID card number). Hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered.\\n\\nWhat can I add to Mr. Forsyth\\'s eloquently put arguments... except applause! Well done that man for standing up and being counted in the \"war against tyranny\".\\n',\n",

       " 'Be careful how you code\\n\\nA new European directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst Bill Thompson.\\n\\nIf it gets its way, the Dutch government will conclude its presidency of the European Union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the European Parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of European citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. If the new law was about border controls, defence or even the new constitution, then our TV screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives. Sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess Middle Britain. After all, how much fuss can you generate about the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions, and the way it amends Article 52 of the 1973 European Patent Convention? Yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the EU\\'s ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in Europe just as they are in the US. Many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. It will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors\\' use of really obvious ideas.\\n\\nIn the US you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re-enter them unless Amazon lets you, because they hold the patent on \"one-click\" online purchase. It is a small invention, but Amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.\\n\\nWe are relatively free from this sort of thing over here, but perhaps not for long. The new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s. They have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the Council of Ministers, radically modified by the European Parliament and then re-presented in their original form. Some national governments seem to be aware of the problems. Poland has rejected the proposal and Germany\\'s main political parties have opposed it, but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection. Early in December the British government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals. Science Minister Lord Sainsbury went along to listen and outline the UK position, but according to those present, it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned.\\n\\nThe draft Directive is being put through the council as what is called an \"A\" item and can only be approved or rejected. No discussion or amendment is allowed. So why should we be worried? First, there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments. This goes to the heart of the European project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried. If coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow?\\n\\nMore directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else\\'s patent. This is not about stealing software, as code is already protected by copyright. Patents are not copyright, but something much stronger. A patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately. I have never, to my shame, managed to read Lord Byron\\'s Childe Harold\\'s Pilgrimage. If it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then I could defend myself in court by claiming that I had simply made it up and it was coincidence. The same does not hold for a patent. If I sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the LZW algorithm used in GIF files, then I am in trouble under patent law, at least in the US. Coincidence is no defence. The proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are US-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents. They have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.\\n\\nEven this system breaks down, of course, as Microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by Eolas which claimed that Internet Explorer (and other browsers) infringed an Eolas patent. That one was eventually thrown out, but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars. But small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade. Much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the Apache web server, the GNU/Linux operating system and the fearsomely popular Firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. The damage to software will not happen overnight, of course. If the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products. Eventually someone will decide to attack Linux directly, probably with some secret funding from one or two large players. The new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas. And it will damage Europe\\'s computer industry. We can only hope that the Council of Ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law.\\n\\nBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.\\n',\n",
       " \"Verizon 'seals takeover of MCI'\\n\\nVerizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.\\n\\nThe two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.\\n\\nShareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.\\n\\nMCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.\\n\",\n",

Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; Â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before. Chinese PC sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years, but are now growing more slowly. The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market. But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn.\\n\\nIf the $1.75bn agreement Lenovo signed with IBM on 8 December goes through, it will mark the end of an era. IBM pioneered the desktop PC market in the early 1980s, although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. In any case, margins in PC market are now wafer thin, and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant Dell. But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move, designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage. Its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago, largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. There have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because US government agencies fear it could offer China opportunities for industrial espionage.

England scored first through Martin Corry but had \"tries\" from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey disallowed. Andy Robinson\\'s men have now lost nine of their last 14 matches since the 2003 World Cup final. The defeat also heralded England\\'s worst run in the championship since 1987. Ireland last won the title, then the Five Nations, in 1985, but 20 years on they share top spot in the table on maximum points with Wales. And Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\'s side banished the ghosts of 2003 when England were rampant 42-6 victors in claiming the Grand Slam at Lansdowne Road. In front of a supercharged home crowd on a dry but blustery day in Dublin, Ireland tore into the white-shirted visitors from the kick-off and made their intentions clear when O\\'Gara landed a fourth-minute drop-goal.\\n\\nEngland took their time to settle but their first real venture into Ireland\\'s half produced a simple score for Corry. The number eight picked up the ball from the back of a ruck and found an absence of green jerseys between himself and the Irish line, racing 25 yards to touch down. England fly-half Charlie Hodgson nailed the conversion from out on the left, but almost immediately O\\'Gara, winning his 50th cap, answered with two penalties in quick succession. England were awarded a penalty of their own on the halfway line after 20 minutes, and Hodgson, the villain at Twickenham, coolly bisected the posts. The first quarter was marked by periods of tactical kicking, but it was Ireland who were showing more willingness to spread the ball wide to their eager and inventive backs. A series of probes led by the talismanic O\\'Driscoll, back from hamstring injury, resulted in a penalty but Ireland chose to kick for touch.\\n\\nFrom the line-out, the ball was recycled back to O\\'Gara, who stroked his second drop-goal, this time off the right upright. As the interval approached, wing Josh Lewsey was the catalyst for England\\'s most promising attack. The Wasps star raced up his touchline and Hodgson\\'s cross-kick put in Mark Cueto for an apparent score, but the Sale wing was ruled to have started in front of the kicker. England began the second half well and had Ireland pinned in their own half. But another English indiscretion on a rare Irish break-out awarded O\\'Gara a kick at goal, which he missed. England\\'s pressure continued, and a wave of attacks saw centre Jamie Noon dragged down yards from the line before Hodgson landed a drop-goal.\\n\\nThe lead was shortlived, however. Ireland raced upfield, deft handling from the backs, including a clever dummy from Geordan Murphy on Hodgson, ending with O\\'Driscoll going over in the right corner and touching down close to the posts. O\\'Gara missed a penalty which would have put Ireland nine points clear, and the home crowd breathed a sigh of relief when Hodgson\\'s cross-kick was fumbled by lock Ben Kay near the line. Anticipation of a home win sent the noise level sky-high, but O\\'Gara missed another chance to seal the game with a wayward drop-goal attempt. Inside the last 10 minutes, England poured forward, spurred on by scrum-half Matt Dawson, who replaced Leicester\\'s Harry Ellis. But despite one near miss with the pack over the line - not checked on the TV replay by referee Jonathan Kaplan - England were unable to pull off a face-saving win. Ireland next face France at Lansdowne Road in two weeks\\' time before the potential title decider against Wales in Cardiff.

Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England\\'s Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I\\'m not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown\\'s Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don\\'t think we\\'ll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers\\' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don\\'t give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don\\'t think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him \\'don\\'t increase your public spending, don\\'t give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people\\'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today.

       " 'Intel unveils laser breakthrough\\n\\nIntel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.\\n\\nScientists at Intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. The breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. The Intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve overcome a fundamental limit,\" said Dr Mario Paniccia, director of Intel\\'s photonics technology lab. Writing in the journal Nature, Dr Paniccia - and colleagues Haisheng Rong, Richard Jones, Ansheng Liu, Oded Cohen, Dani Hak and Alexander Fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. Currently, says Dr Paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.\\n\\nTelecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. \"We\\'re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,\" said Dr Paniccia. While work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. This is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. This improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. Dr Paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. \"It creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,\" he said. But the Intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. Even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. Semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. The result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. Dr Paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. \"It\\'s a technical validation that it can work,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lib Dems unveil women\\'s manifesto\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats are attempting to woo female voters with the launch of their manifesto for women.\\n\\nCharles Kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments. He also thinks women will back plans to end university tuition fees and for free long-term care for the elderly. Both Labour and the Conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support. Mr Kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women. \"Two million pensioners in Britain currently live below the government\\'s own poverty line - two-thirds of whom are women,\" he said.\\n\\nHe says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children. The Lib Dem\\'s Citizen\\'s Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues. Under the package, new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of Â£170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. Mr Kennedy also believes the party\\'s plans to use the money saved from not introducing \"illiberal\" ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too. The policies are not new announcements, but the way they are structured as a package to appeal to women is.\\n\\nMr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party\\'s candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women. Party strategists claim that where women candidates replace men turnout rises by 4%. Mr Kennedy began the pitch for female support with an interview on BBC Radio 4\\'s Women\\'s Hour on Monday. During the interview Mr Kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party\\'s general election campaign around the birth of his first child, which is expected in April. The baby and his wife Sarah would be \"priority number one\" even if it arrived in the middle of the election campaign, he said.\\n\\nParty strategists believe winning over a significant proportion of women voters is key to electoral success. A party spokesman said it was courting female votes because they tended to vote more than men and are believed to be more considered and open-minded in deciding who they vote for. Labour\\'s deputy minister for women Jacqui Smith accused the Lib Dems of offering \"false promises\" to women and said their sums did not add up. She said: \"These proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year, and hard working families will pay dearly, through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services\". The Labour party has committed itself to \"universal, affordable and flexible\" childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year-olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm. In September, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if Labour won a third term. The Conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in November they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer. They were also consulting on making childcare costs tax deductible.\\n',\n",

The EFF says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.\\n\\nApple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named Asteroid and has asked the journalists\\' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. \"Rather than confronting the issue of reporter\\'s privilege head-on, Apple is going to the journalist\\'s ISPs for his e-mails,\" said EFF lawyer Kurt Opsahl. \"This undermines a fundamental First Amendment right that protects all reporters. \"If the court lets Apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary,\" he said. The case began in December 2004 when Apple asked a local Californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites AppleInsider.com and PowerPage.org.\\n\\nApple also sent requested information from the Nfox.com, the internet service provider of PowerPage\\'s publisher Jason O-Grady. As well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published, the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines.

Krispy Kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 December. However, the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.\\n\\nIt also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.\\n\\nShares in Krispy Kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. The revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. Krispy Kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. It added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. In a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.\\n\\nKrispy Kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements. \"There are many more questions than answers, especially given increased concerns regarding company liquidity,\" JP Morgan Securities analyst John Ivankoe said in a research note on the firm.

Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to \"pause\" on the bill. Tory leader Michael Howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards. The Liberal Democrats oppose the plans.\\n\\nMr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of \"liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears\" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties. He writes that it is actually a \"profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society - which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear\". Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail. He is also expected to cut the Â£85 cost of the card and passport, for the elderly and those on lower incomes.\\n\\nMr Howard last week said his front bench team had reached a \"collective view\" to back ID cards after holding a \"good discussion\", but admitted it was \"not an easy issue\". He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. But former shadow attorney general Bill Cash said there was still \"very deep\" disquiet about the plan among senior Tories. He told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today the government was \"intensely authoritarian\" and was creating \"increasingly a Big Brother society\". Critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim.\\n\\nMinisters say it would help the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime. But opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the Madrid rail bombing. On Sunday, Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy repeated his call for a \"pause\" in considering the legislation.\\n\\nHe told BBC\\'s Breakfast with Frost programme that Mr Clarke had a \"real opportunity\" on Monday following the departure of Mr Blunkett. \"If you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the New Year? \"That is the sensible way to go about it but I think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all.\" The first cards would be issued in 2008 and, when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.

       " 'When invention turns to innovation\\n\\nIt is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.\\n\\nWhen history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people\\'s lives substantially. But, says Nick Donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at IBM, it was not \"the thing\" itself that actually improved people\\'s lives. It was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. The car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access. \"When we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st Century, we have to think more like this, but faster,\" Mr Donofrio told the BBC News website, after giving the Royal Academy of Engineering 2004 Hinton Lecture. \"The invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. \"The equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did.\" These are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. But what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.\\n\\nWe are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues Mr Donofrio, Industry Week\\'s 2003 Technology Leader of the Year. The hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.\\n\\n\"In the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. \"Somebody had a new thing that would awe you. You weren\\'t quite sure that it did anything, you weren\\'t quite sure if you needed it, you weren\\'t quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool.\" But change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be \"in your face\". It will creep in pervasively. Nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. \"I am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,\" says Mr Donofrio. Pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. The net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air. \"People will not have to do anything to stay connected. People will know their lives are just better,\" says Mr Donofrio. \"Trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.\" Natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.\\n\\nUltimately, there will be, says Mr Donofrio, no value in being \"computer illiterate\". To some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad. To Mr Donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. Behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and \"deep computing\", says Mr Donofrio. Deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing. It has value, according to IBM, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.\\n\\nBut pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world. As computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.\\n\\nThis is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. \"I am confident that the SET [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,\" he says. \"If I am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. \"Women tend to have those traits a lot better than men.\" Eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says. In the UK, a DTI-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on SET industry boards. IBM, according to Mr Donofrio, has 30%. \"Our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career.\" The whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to Mr Donofrio. \"We believe in the whole issue of global diversity,\" he says. \"Our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse. They expect us to look like them. \"As more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.\"\\n',\n",

However, Labour has so far unable been unable to comment on the implications of the West Ham result.\\n\\nAshok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities\\' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected. \"I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates,\" Mr Vishwanathan said.\\n\\nLast month the chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) also called for ethnic minority shortlists in certain circumstances. A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. \"We will be raising it with each of the party leaders on a formal basis and helping them find the most appropriate way forward,\" the spokesman said. Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group. Twelve of them represent Labour, and one is a Liberal Democrat. If ethnic minorities were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority MPs.\\n',\n",

Hoddle has been linked with a return to former club Southampton but Wolves have won the race for his services. He has been out of the game since being sacked at Spurs in September 2003 and worked alongside Wolves caretaker boss Stuart Gray at Southampton. Hoddle began his managerial career as player-boss with Swindon before moving on to Chelsea and then taking up the England job.\\n\\nHis spell in charge of the national side came to an end after the 1998 World Cup when he made controversial remarks about the disabled in a newspaper interview. The 47-year-old later returned to management with Southampton, where he again succeeded Jones - as he has now done at Wolves. He engineered an upturn in Saints' fortunes before being lured to White Hart Lane by Tottenham - the club where he made his name as a player. That relationship turned sour at the start of the last campaign and he left the London club early last season. Since then he has applied unsuccessfully for the post of France manager and had also been linked with a return to Southampton.

       " \"Campbell rescues Arsenal\\n\\nSol Campbell proved to be an unlikely match-winner to earn Arsenal a hard-fought win at Portsmouth.\\n\\nThe England defender lashed home a 25-yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take Arsenal back into second spot, five points behind Chelsea. But before Campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to Pompey striker Ricardo Fuller. In the first half he blasted wide when clear, and his control let him down in the second half when well placed. Portsmouth got plenty of bodies behind the ball to deny Arsenal space in the early stages. But their marking was slack at a corner and Patrick Vieira should have done better when the ball fell to him 16 yards out. A mistake by Arjan de Zeeuw let Thierry Henry in behind the Pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal Linvoy Primus got in a saving tackle. With just Fuller as an out-and-out striker, Portsmouth's shape made life difficult for Arsenal. But a delightful touch by Robin van Persie gave Henry a sight of goal, although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble Jamie Ashdown.\\n\\nAshdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and Kolo Toure headed just wide and, as Arsenal began to press, Van Persie blasted over a good opportunity after Henry had set him up. Henry took a quick return pass from Vieira but Ashdown was out quickly to block, and there were some anxious seconds for Pompey as the ball ran loose before Matthew Taylor cleared. After playing second fiddle, Portsmouth should have taken the lead on 34 minutes. Referee Howard Webb played a good advantage to allow Steve Stone to send Gary O'Neil away but, having shrugged off Toure, the Pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards. As half-time approached, Henry teased a shot through a ruck of players and inches wide. At the other end, Fuller broke clear but failed to hit the target as Toure closed him down.\\n\\nFuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when Patrik Berger's break and slipped pass played him clear. But a poor first touch lost him the opportunity and even when he checked back and went down under Vieira's challenge, referee Webb was not interested. Fuller paid the price when he gave way on 55 minutes to Aiyegbeni Yakubu, who returned after six weeks out with a knee injury. But it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from Ashdown to cling on to Van Persie's shot as Henry sniffed for scraps.\\n\\nPortsmouth were growing in confidence and keeper Manuel Almunia had to stand his ground to beat away a powerful shot from Berger. Arsenal were struggling to find their rhythm but took the lead through the unlikely source of Campbell. The England defender needed little invitation as Pompey backed off to stride forward and lash a ferocious shot past Ashdown. Arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when Mathieu Flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from Henry's free-kick. Almunia went full length to grab Berger's long-range shot, while Ashdown palmed away substitute Dennis Bergkamp's shot.\\n\\nAshdown, Griffin, De Zeeuw, Primus, Taylor, Stone, O'Neil, Faye (Berkovic 83), Berger, LuaLua, Fuller (Yakubu 55).\\n\\nSubs not used: Hislop, Quashie, Cisse.\\n\\nAlmunia, Lauren, Toure, Campbell, Cole, Pires, Flamini, Vieira, Clichy, Van Persie (Bergkamp 68), Henry.\\n\\nSubs not used: Lehmann, Fabregas, Senderos, Hoyte.\\n\\nCole.\\n\\nCampbell 75.\\n\\n20,170.\\n\\nH Webb (S Yorkshire).\\n\",\n",

The deficit with China, up 30.5% at $162bn, was the largest ever recorded with a single country. However, on a monthly basis the US trade gap narrowed by 4.9% in December to Â£56.4bn. The US consumer\\'s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of President Bush\\'s economic policies.\\n\\nDemocrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices. For example, they believe China\\'s currency policy - which US manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40% - has given China\\'s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against US competitors.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Bush administration argues that the US deficit reflects the fact the America is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods. Some economists say this may allow an upward revision of US economic growth in the fourth quarter. But others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar-denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth. For all of 2004, US exports rose 12.3% to $1.15 trillion, but imports rose even faster by 16.3% to a new record of $1.76 trillion. Foreign oil exports surged by 35.7% to a record $180.7bn, reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand. Imports were not affected by the dollar\\'s weakness last year. \"We expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend,\" said economist Marie-Pierre Ripert at IXIS.\\n',\n",

Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artists in this year\\'s list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.\\n\\nThey were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt \"great\" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. \"Anyone that says they don\\'t want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar,\" he said. One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times\\' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were \"spiky but in love with pop\". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music\\'s chart show, said the band had \"great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound\". \"The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,\" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set \"sounded like a potential single\".\\n\\nUnconditional reached the summit of the station\\'s listeners\\' chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as \"an unheard of achievement for a debut single\".\\n\\nQ magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were \"pretty-boy New York clothes horses\" with \"an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes\". Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin. Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets\\' record label. US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre\\'s latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival.

In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor.

He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n\\nTory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n\\nHe acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don\\'t pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n\\nSources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n\\nThey said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them.

The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part. The Dingolfing site will now be closed all next week instead of for just two days.

The number of holes considered \"critical\" is more than usual. They affect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes.

Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out.

       " 'Music man to the Oscars\\n\\nBill Conti\\'s job of musical director of the Oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.\\n\\nThis year marks Conti\\'s 17th turn at the helm of the Academy Awards orchestra. \"The excitement is a live performance as a musician,\" he says. \"All of your colleagues, everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. All the important people. \"I guess it\\'s just a television show but we always think it\\'s a bit more.\\' The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show. As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. But you don\\'t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it\\'s exciting,\" explains Conti. And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. \"We don\\'t know who the winners will be. So when they say, \\'the winner is\\', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,\" adds Conti.\\n\\nThe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show\\'s producers.\\n\\nThe decision to drown out or \\'kill\\' the offending star with music is relayed from the director\\'s box to the orchestra via Conti\\'s earpiece. \"I don\\'t feel good about it at all. It\\'s not my call though,\" he says. \"When the director says \\'music\\' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. We don\\'t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. \"The person that\\'s been cut off, who\\'s 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it\\'s death time.\" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. \"Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,\" he says. Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a moment in the sun,\" he says. \"When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. \"But there\\'s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they\\'re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.\"\\n\\nThe image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. \"There\\'s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. I can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.\\n\\n\"I have to communicate with the director. I have a little microphone that\\'s attached to my headset. To open up that microphone, I have a footswitch,\" he explains. Conti\\'s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. Conti immediately told the show\\'s director: \"I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we\\'re not going to die for this show - you must do something or I\\'m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we\\'re going to be home in 10 minutes. \"\\'Oh no Bill don\\'t do anything,\" came the response. \"Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we\\'re playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.\" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. \"No one died, it\\'s not a big story, but it was scary at the time,\" laughs Conti. When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor\\'s Ball with his family. \"I have a drink and relive the show,\" he says. \"I\\'m not for too much carousing.

They want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. Up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 March. However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape. In four days, Britain\\'s biggest union Unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. Other public sector unions have pledged to follow. It is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.\\n\\nThe five unions meeting Mr Prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. This would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. But a spokesman for Mr Prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in April. Privately ministers believe this will be the \"less painful\" option, our correspondent added. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn\\'t it ironic that they\\'re saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it\\'s completely unacceptable.\"\\n\\nUnison\\'s 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers\\' Union\\'s 70,000 and Amicus\\' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Mr Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. It is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cole faces lengthy injury lay-off\\n\\nAston Villa\\'s Carlton Cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.\\n\\nThe striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. \"Carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge,\" said Villa boss David O\\'Leary. \"I won\\'t be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea.\" Cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because O\\'Leary had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of Darius Vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of Luke Moore has alleviated some of the Villa\\'s manager\\'s problems in that department.\\n',\n",
       " \"Ireland 21-19 Argentina\\n\\nAn injury-time dropped goal by Ronan O'Gara stole victory for Ireland from underneath the noses of Argentina at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.\\n\\nO'Gara kicked all of Ireland's points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought Ireland in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina's Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged Ireland with the first try of the game. Ireland turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O'Gara finally got Ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, Ireland continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O'Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O'Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed Ireland to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. Ireland had to rely on O'Gara's boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland's chance came when Argentina's number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O'Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But Ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O'Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Blair defends terror law changes\\n\\nThe prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying \"several hundred\" people in the UK are plotting terror attacks.\\n\\nThe government is facing opposition from Tory and Lib Dem MPs and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final Commons debate on the changes. But Tony Blair said there could be no concession on the \"basic principle\". Mr Blair told the BBC the \"control orders\" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. Critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. But the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.\\n\\nAn explanation is being sent by Home Secretary Charles Clarke to all MPs and peers ahead of the final debate in the House of Commons. On Sunday, Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. And Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. Some 32 Labour MPs voted against the legislation last week. Barbara Follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in South Africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.\\n\\nBut the government is continuing to insist that \"control orders\" must be issued by the home secretary. Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4\\'s Woman\\'s Hour: \"We are being advised by the police and the security services... \"What they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. \"And these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.\"\\n\\nA YouGov poll in the Daily Telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. But Tory leader Michael Howard told BBC News that the government was again making a mistake in \"rushing\" anti-terrorism legislation. \"I very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this.\" He said after meeting Tony Blair he had been left with the impression that \"he really wasn\\'t interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward\". Mr Clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the House of Lords, where Labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group Liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. She said the legislation was \"a travesty and a perversion of justice\" and would remain \"unpalatable\" even if a judge was involved early in the process.\\n',\n",

Following complaints, the Advertising Standards Authority contacted Five to cease promotion of crime show CSI:NY. Five admitted it had sent out 55,000 promotion packs but had now stopped. The promotion material was sent in brown envelope of the type used by investigators in the series, a spin-off from the highly successful CSI: Crime Scene Investigation series, which also runs on Five. The pack also features pictures of forensic evidence from a crime scene and a wanted poster, which did have a CSI:NY logo printed in large at the bottom.\\n\\nFive said it had received 100 complaints but that it had been surprised at the reaction because it was \"obvious this material is promoting a drama\".

       " \"Henson stakes early Lions claim\\n\\nThe Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.\\n\\nThe player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was Gavin Henson. He's very confident. You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. He certainly showed some nice touches. He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. And that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. He needs to come up against Brian O'Driscoll or a big French midfield. Wales fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me. He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. He showed he can control a game. With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.\\n\\nJones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturday's game. Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. However, I still think White and Phil Vickery will be in the frame. Some English players did their cause no harm. I thought Joe Worsley had a solid game and Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey both did nothing wrong. But it looked too soon for young Mathew Tait and I think it will be a while before we see him again. Despite being written off beforehand several Scots caught my eye against France.\\n\\nTom Smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of Chris Cusiter, Jason White and Ally Hogg all made their mark. Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward. The star of Ireland's win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand. Brian O'Driscoll is a class act. He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. Gordon D'Arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a Henson, D'Arcy, O'Driscoll combination in the Lions midfield. Paul O'Connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm O'Kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character. But they will be a bit worried after the Italian pack drove them off their own ball on Sunday, although I used to play in Italy and I know how difficult it can be. One player who didn't impress me was Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel. He choked late on in the second half when Wales were trailing. They had good possession and he kicked the ball away - I wouldn't want him as my Lions scrum-half after that.\\n\",\n",
       " 'China bans new tobacco factories\\n\\nThe world\\'s biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built.\\n\\nChina already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily. The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco, which plans to become China\\'s first foreign cigarette maker. A spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report.\\n\\n\"China won\\'t allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures\", said Xing Wangli, a spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily. He also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution. China has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. Smoking is fashionable in China, where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs, such as salesmen. More young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. In July 2004, Bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (Â£800m) joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there.\\n\\nThe State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal, leading to an embarrassing public row. Bat told the BBC at that time that it had not negotiated with the STMC, and secured approval from \"the highest levels of government\". Since then, the row has flared occasionally, most recently at a forum in November. Bat consistently declines to comment. \"Xing\\'s statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco\", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. The Bat spokeswoman said: \"There is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in July last year. The central government of China is the authority that approved our strategic investment.\" The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the French news agency AFP. The joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build. The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. However, if the STMA continues to take a tough stance, expansion opportunities could be limited.\\n\\nChina\\'s tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West. China Daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth, making more than 210bn yuan ($25.4bn) in pre-tax profits last year, almost double the figure in 2000. The paper made no mention of health concerns. The STMA is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry, closing some factories, though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.\\n',\n",
       " 'Gamers could drive high-definition\\n\\nTV, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.\\n\\nIt is called high-definition - HD for short - and it is already hugely popular in Japan and the US. It is set, according to analysts, to do for images what CDs did for sound. Different equipment able to receive HD signals is needed though and is expensive. But Europe\\'s gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. Europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream HDTV.\\n\\nTo view it, it needs to be transmitted in HD format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. The next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. And most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. \"In the next generation [of consoles] HD support is mandatory,\" Dr Mark Tuffy games systems director at digital content firm THX told the BBC News website. \"Every game is going to be playable in HD. \"So consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on HDTVs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. \"It\\'s going to change really the way they look at gaming.\"\\n\\nAt the end of last year, Chris Deering, Sony\\'s European president, made a prediction that 20 million European households would have HDTV sets by 2008. A previous prediction from analysts Datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. But those in Europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about Â£2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. Satellite broadcaster BSkyB is planning HDTV services in 2006 and the BBC intends to produce all of its content in HD by 2010.\\n\\nUntil broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, TV content will be limited. All TV images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. Most standard UK TV pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. HD offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. This means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard TV. \"Probably, in the UK [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in \\'look what this TV can do\\', until HD is really adopted by broadcasters,\" explains Dr Tuffy. But gamers are also the ideal target audience for HD because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. They are used to spending money on hardware to match a game\\'s requirements. Demographics have changed too and the \"sweet spot\" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. This means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and HD projectors, earlier than others.\\n\\nHigher capacity storage discs, such as HD-DVD and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.\\n\\nFor console developers though, HD offers some production changes. It could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks Dr Tuffy. \"But we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a PC game and apply it to a console,\" he says. \"You are literally going to get to the point, with a Lord of the Rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the CGI stuff from the DVD. \"And the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless.\" With HD, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. This could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. But it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. At that point, says Dr Tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.\\n',\n",

       " \"Gritty return for Prince of Persia\\n\\nStill basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.\\n\\nThis sequel gives the franchise a grim, gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence. As before, you control the super-athletic prince from a third-person perspective. The time-travelling plot hinges on the Dahaka, an all-consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages. The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation.\\n\\nStudiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old-fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be. Ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga, Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.\\n\\nThose flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect. Combining them at speed is the best fun, although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill. Until you reach that point, it is a haphazard business. All too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path. The expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct, but combat is what is really been stepped up, and there is more of it than before. The game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways. Slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off.\\n\\nWarrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.\\n\\nIt is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax. That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game. The music is probably the worst aspect - a merit-free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off. There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game. Perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be. Somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts, and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable. But that is not to say Warrior Within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy. It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Call to overhaul UK state pension\\n\\nThe UK pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.\\n\\nThe Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said replacing the state pension with a \"citizen\\'s pension\" would help tackle inequality and complexity. The change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the UK rather than National Insurance (NI) contributions.

The think tank\\'s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the Pensions Commission\\'s initial report into UK retirement savings. According to the Pensions Commission\\'s report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. As a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of UK pensioners.

       " 'When technology gets personal\\n\\nIn 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. By then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says Ian Pearson, BT\\'s resident futurologist.\\n\\nIt\\'s all part of what\\'s known as a \"pervasive ambient world\", where \"chips are everywhere\". Mr Pearson does not have a crystal ball. His job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future. Inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets, in homes, in appliances, on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that \"think\". Forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. Ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around. Images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. But now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics. Such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.\\n\\nSo MP3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one\\'s clothing, says Mr Pearson. \"So the gadgets that fill up your handbag, when we integrate those into fabric, we can actually get rid of all that stuff. You won\\'t necessarily see the electronics.\" Wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while \"video tattoos\", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as TV screens for those on the move. However, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions. If technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says Baroness Susan Greenfield. At a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the Royal Society in London, neuroscientist Baroness Greenfield cautioned we \"can\\'t just sleepwalk into the future\".\\n\\nYet this technology is already upon us. Researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. MP3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.\\n\\nThese \"smart fabrics\" have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. At the nanoscale, materials can be \"tuned\" to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems. The textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. Many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine, defence, healthcare, sports, and communications. Professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. Nanoscale titanium dioxide (TiO2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. These have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or UV light. Such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance, to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces, and applied to windows so they clean themselves. Dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. But Baroness Greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. If our clothing, skin, and \"personal body networks\" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. Mr Pearson picks up the theme, pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become \"cyborgian\". His main concern is \"privacy\". \"We are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don\\'t want every passer-by to know. \"So we have to make sure we build security in this. If you are wearing smart make-up, where electronics are controlling the appearance, you don\\'t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead.\" As technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently? \"We cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,\" warns Baroness Greenfield. There have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. This paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. Clearly, the organic, carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. The cyborg - a very familiar part-human, part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.\\n',\n",
       " 'Director Nair\\'s Vanity project\\n\\nIndian film director Mira Nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make William Makepeace Thackeray\\'s novel Vanity Fair - as the book has been a favourite through her life.\\n\\nThe book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp, played in the film by Reese Witherspoon. Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film\\'s second half. \"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service\\'s Masterpiece programme. \"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\\n\\nSince her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! - nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar and winner of Best First Feature at Cannes - Nair has become one of India\\'s most famous and respected directors. She is not restricted to Bollywood, however - she followed Salaam Bombay! with Mississippi Masala, starring Denzel Washington, and The Perez Family, her first Hollywood film.\\n\\nHer career peaked with Monsoon Wedding in 2001, which won the Golden Lion award at Venice. Nair\\'s Indian-style adaptation of Vanity Fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the US - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the Bollywood elements as \"jarring.\" The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India. But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world. \"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said. \"But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. \"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray\\'s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. \"That perspective was something I really loved.\"\\n\\nNair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. \"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said. \"For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. It is a visceral response.\\n\\n\"Thackeray describes Becky Sharp as a minx. Also she\\'s described as someone who\\'s tiny, red-headed and thin. Reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.\" Having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, Witherspoon then became pregnant. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. \"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said \\'knock her up, won\\'t you, I need some flesh on the girl\\',\" she joked. \"I\\'m not a fan of the underfed Los Angeles actor at all. This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. \"I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.\" Nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise Witherspoon\\'s \"bump\" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. \"She runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,\" Nair said. \"But there\\'s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment, because of the bump.\"\\n',\n",

You'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras. There is a one-disc version that has commentaries and a Making Of but the two-disc adds more. Unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects. They're covered but there's also a general Production Diary and a Post-Production feature.\\n\\nRemember the National Lottery's draw machines Arthur and Guinevere? They were more accurate than this glossy Hollywood version of the tale.\\n\\nBut as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it: King Arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent. Clive Owen is the brooding king, Keira Knightly rises above her costume and Ray Winstone gives it all some grit. It's at its best in its battle scenes which are well done and are also the best part of the Making Of extra.\\n\\nLess flashy than a David Attenborough show and less detailed than a Simon Schama one, the BBC series British Isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. Admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows Alan Titchmarsh left Ground Force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. But Titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present-day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating. He's now written an accompanying book, too.\\n\",\n",

Laurent Beaudoin, part of the family that controls the Montreal-based firm, will take on the role of CEO under a newly created management structure. Analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. Under Mr Tellier\\'s tenure at the company, which began in January 2003, plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75,000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced. The firm\\'s snowmobile division and defence services unit were also sold and Bombardier started the development of a new aircraft seating 110 to 135 passengers.\\n\\nMr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world\\'s top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. But Bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. Earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (Â£19.2m) in the third quarter, down from a profit of $133m a year ago. \"I understand the board\\'s concern that I would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and execute strategies, and the need to reshape the management structure at this time,\" Mr Tellier said in a statement on Monday. Bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by Mr Tellier\\'s would continue to be implemented. Shares in Bombardier lost 65 Canadian cents or 25% on the news to 1.90 Canadian dollars before rallying to 2.20 Canadian dollars.\\n',\n",

The Gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. And the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. Later, Prime Minister Tony Blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.\\n\\nAnalysing Mr Brown\\'s position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw \"sharp dividing lines\" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. He would contrast Labour\\'s plan to invest Â£60bn in services with a Tory plan to cut spending by Â£35bn. \"Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade,\" our correspondent said.\\n\\nOn Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March. But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election. The Tories accuse Labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.\\n\\nFollowing the chancellor\\'s keynote speech, the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on Saturday. Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election. Capital Radio DJ Margherita Taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. The prime minister\\'s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour\\'s election strategist told Radio 4\\'s Today programme on Saturday. Mr Blair has \"the same passion and the same commitments for the job\" as when Labour came to power in 1997, he said.\\n\\nAnd he confirmed Mr Blair\\'s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. He said: \"I\\'m the General Election co-ordinator and I don\\'t know, and Tony has not made up his mind.\" On Friday, the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of England, during which he unveiled his party\\'s six pre-election pledges. Starting in London, he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were Labour\\'s achievements on the economy, crime, education and public services. The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour\\'s election campaign - were \"worthless\".\\n',\n",

Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath's starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.\\n\\nHe was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem. Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. England's players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday.\\n\",\n",

The South Yorkshire company, led by new chief executive Gerry Spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. In early trade on Thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. UK Coal said it was making \"significant progress\" in shaking up the business. It had introduced new wage structures, a new daily maintenance regime for machinery at its mines and methods to continue mining in adverse conditions. The company said these actions should \"significantly uplift earnings\". It expected 2005 to be a \"transitional year\" and to return to profitability in 2006.\\n\\nThe recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. Total production costs were Â£1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just Â£1.18 per gigajoule. \"We have a long journey ahead to fix these issues. We continue to make progress and great strides have already been made,\" said Mr Spindler. UK Coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Yorkshire, the West Midlands, Northumberland and Durham.\\n',\n",

Me, I can\\'t play on grass.\" However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. \"It\\'s a relief for me. Two grand slams, it\\'s already something. But with this one I worked really hard for it,\" he said. \"Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way.\\n\\n\"If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it.\" The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam. \"I didn\\'t expect that (to win the 2000 US Open) - it was against Sampras, I wasn\\'t the favourite so I had no pressure whatsoever,\" he said. \"After the first final that I didn\\'t win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn\\'t see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore. \"I was once in the semi-finals of the French Open, but I didn\\'t believe I can win it. \"I just couldn\\'t handle the pressure. You need to believe in yourself, and I didn\\'t.\"\\n\\nAnd after losing the first set 6-1 to Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday\\'s final, Safin said he began to doubt himself again. \"I am 25. I\\'m playing against Hewitt. At least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,\" he said. \"It\\'s like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: \\'This is not my day.

British Music Rights (BMR) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.\\n\\nSongwriter Guy Chambers, who has worked with stars including Robbie Williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme. He said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from \"unscrupulous\" individuals. At a debate in London to launch the scheme, Chambers said: \"I think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. \"These lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers.\" The education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. It will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.\\n\\nHenri Yoxall, general manager of British Music Rights, told BBC News schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. The scheme - which is an extension of BMR\\'s Respect the Value of Music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters Feargal Sharkey, Lucie Silvas and Grammy Award-winning composer David Arnold. Silvas said: \"I think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. \"I wish I had been given an opportunity like this when I was at school.\" Emma Pike, director general of British Music Rights, said: \"We believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools.

       " 'Media gadgets get moving\\n\\nPocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts.\\n\\nLast year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the Windows-based Creative Zen portable media player, the Samsung Yepp, the iRiver PMC-100, and the Archos AV400 series among others. But this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. Archos launched its latest range of its Linux-based portable media devices at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Friday. Dubbed the Pocket Media Assistant PMA430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. \"Consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,\" said Henri Crohas, chief of Archos. \"And now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time.\" Archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people\\'s pockets, after the mobile.\\n\\nUnlike Windows-based players, the Archos AV400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as TVs, as well as playback. The content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device.\\n\\nRecording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. And wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. Archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to Linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. Microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at CES, primarily for US consumers though. It has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company TiVo, which Bill Gates also showcased in his keynote speech at CES. The TiVo To Go service means that US consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their TiVos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the Windows-based portable media players or smartphones. It also said it had launched a service with MTV to let people watch Comedy Central, VH1 and Country Music TV on its devices. And a service is launching with MSN to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the PC onto the portable devices. But the ability to record directly from TV, VCR, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which Windows-based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.\\n\\nThe increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. Recent research by Jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. Only 13% of Europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. More seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices.\\n\\n\"This year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media,\" Microsoft\\'s Mike Coleman told the BBC News website. \"We are very bullish about it. The fact that I can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,\" he added. The fact that Europeans are far larger public transport users than Americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. There is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. Although Microsoft\\'s content distribution deals are for the US market at the moment, talks were \"always on-going\" with European content suppliers to offer similar services. Various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. But that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. The possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. CES, which runs from 6 to 9 January, showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.\\n',\n",

Santa Monica-based Activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. Video games are \"big business\", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. We \"would like to get into it\".\\n\\nThe success of products such as Sony\\'s Playstation, Microsoft\\'s X-Box and Nintendo\\'s Game Cube have boosted demand for video games. The days of arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Pac-Man and Donkey Kong are long gone. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. And with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.\\n\\nMr Chernin, however, told the FT that News Corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. \"We are struggling with the gap between companies like Electronic Arts (EA), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,\" he explained during a conference in Phoenix, Arizona. \"These may be too focused on one or two product lines.\" Activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (Â£1.57bn), compared to EA\\'s $17.8bn.

       " 'Aviator and Vera take Bafta glory\\n\\nHollywood blockbuster The Aviator and low-budget British movie Vera Drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 Bafta film awards. The Aviator was declared best film, and its star Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress. But Vera Drake scored best director for Mike Leigh while Imelda Staunton took the hotly contested best actress award. Jamie Foxx won best actor for Ray, while British actor Clive Owen took best supporting actor for Closer. The two actors have repeated their success at the Golden Globes in January. But big British hope Kate Winslet walked away empty-handed on Saturday despite two nominations for best actress. Celebrating his win, the Oscar-nominated Owen told reporters: \"The whole award season is new to me because I haven\\'t won anything before. All of that is a bit overwhelming.\" Blanchett, who won a Bafta in 1999 for her leading role in Elizabeth, said: \"Winning a Bafta means an enormous amount to me.\" She thanked the woman she played, Katharine Hepburn, for paving the way for women to work in film. \"Thank you very much, I\\'m sure you\\'re pleased, although you\\'re not able to see this,\" she said.\\n\\nThe Aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while Vera Drake also scooped best costume design. Staunton, who is up for an Oscar for her role in Vera Drake, arrived wearing a green silk and chiffon beaded evening dress. \"Thank you very much. I\\'m so thrilled and so grateful and I\\'m delighted that the success of Vera Drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good,\" she said on accepting her award. Her director Leigh, who beat Martin Scorsese to the best director award, told the audience: \"We always say it was a surprise and sometimes I\\'ve said it and not meant it. On this occasion, given the other names, it\\'s a real surprise and an extraordinary honour. \"It\\'s an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as I think Vera Drake is and an epic with such a small budget.\" Best actor Foxx could not make the ceremony, but actress Helen Mirren read out his acceptance speech. \"I\\'m honoured and proud to receive this Bafta. I\\'d like to thank the late Ray Charles himself.\" He apologised for not being in London, joking: \"Unfortunately I\\'m stuck driving a car in LA at gunpoint and I can\\'t get away.\" DiCaprio, who lost out on the best actor Bafta to Foxx, will face him again at the Academy Awards in two weeks\\' time.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the first time I\\'ve come to the Baftas because it\\'s the first time I\\'ve been nominated,\" he told reporters on the red carpet. \"I\\'ve appreciated British cinema for a long time and to be recognised like this is a special honour.\" Other winners included The Motorcycle Diaries which took best foreign film and best music, while Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won best original screenplay and best editing. Best British film was My Summer of Love, the story of two young women and their developing relationship, while Foxx\\'s movie Ray, a bio-pic of late singer Ray Charles, also took best sound. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban won the Orange Film Of The Year, voted for by the public.\\n\\nThe Orange British Academy Film Awards are being shown on BBC One from 2010 GMT.\\n',\n",
       " 'Robotic pods take on car design\\n\\nA new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.\\n\\nThe company\\'s vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like \"i-unit\" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.\\n\\nAlso on display at the show will be the egg-shaped \"i-foot\". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.\\n\\nStanding at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. \"They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production,\" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. \"They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. \"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see \\'who\\' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the \\'personal transport\\' marketplace.\"\\n\\nThe personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota\\'s prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual\\'s particular mobility needs. While Toyota\\'s prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.\\n\\nExperts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.\\n\\n\"Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,\" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. \"You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.\" Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: \"The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. \"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. \"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri. \"In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. \"This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.\" Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. \"The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,\" said Dr Gillingwater. \"What\\'s their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. \"Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\"\\n',\n",

And world number three Roddick dropped a set to Korean player Hyung-Taik Lee, before pulling out a 6-3 3-6 6-2 win in San Jose, California. Seventh seed Jurgen Melzer came through 6-3 6-3 against Xavier Malisse - winner in Delray Beach last week. Frenchman Cyril Saulnier, meanwhile, fired 19 aces to secure a 6-1 7-6 win over Czech qualifier Tomas Zib.\\n\\nRoddick broke a racket in frustration in the third game of the second set. and afterwards was unimpressed with his form. \"I\\'m not playing great,\" he said. \"But I\\'m through and I\\'m going to keep battling. \"A lot of people are under the assumption that it\\'s easy to play well every week and it\\'s not.\" It is the 12th time in 13 appearances at the event that Agassi, now 34, has progressed to the quarter-final stage. He came from 0-40 down in the opening game to hold serve and gradually wore Carlsen down after attacking his backhand. Agassi also employed several lobs and charged to the net to unsettle the 31-year-old Dane, ranked 88th in the world. \"As the match went on, I got real patient and waited for my opportunities and felt pretty good,\" said Agassi.\\n',\n",

World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China\\'s Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt.

Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China\\'s Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.\\n\\nBefore her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. \"I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,\" she said. Williams was also far from content. \"I don\\'t know what I was doing there,\" she said. \"It was really windy and I hadn\\'t played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.\" But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. \"I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,\" she said. \"It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'What\\'s next for next-gen consoles?\\n\\nThe next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers? We may not know when they will be released, what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months. The details of PlayStation 3, Xbox 2 (codename Xenon) and Nintendo\\'s so-called Revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless.\\n\\n\"We know maybe what the PS3 will do, but we can only guess,\" said Rory Armes, studio general manager for video game giant Electronic Arts in Europe. \"It\\'s a horrendous effort in the first year,\" he admitted. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, said Mr Armes, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo to send kits. Although the details may not be nailed down, Mr Armes said EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. \"The rumours are that PlayStation 3 will have a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2],\" he said.\\n\\n\"Microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost, while Sony has more experience in hardware. I think Sony will be able to push more into a box at cost.\"\\n\\nWhat is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. It is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Microsoft boss Bill Gates said Xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. While short on detail, he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a PC and offer \"great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people, more communications, more media, more connectivity\". Sony is thought to have a similar vision for PS3 while Nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games.\\n\\nUntil it is clear precisely what the new machines can do, developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles. \"We are working on new libraries of effects. A lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in PC gaming, such as pixel shaders and normal mapping.\"\\n\\nMr Dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles. \"We want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game.\" In the first year at least, developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. Graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for PCs should be expected. Simon Gardner, president of Climax\\'s Action Studio, said: \"It\\'s definitely an exciting time. We want to give more freedom to the player. We want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play. \"The environments will be much more believable and dramatic, growing and changing as you play. \"There will be a breadth of effects, more involving worlds to play in.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. We\\'re being given more tools. \"For the average consumer, we can get things of a more filmic quality.\" Gerhard Florin, head of EA in Europe, said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. Many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely. \"PS3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies,\" said Mr Florin. He said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles. \"A gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros. When he goes home he goes online and he could buy AI and levels as you go.\\n\\n\"It\\'s much smarter if you can get levels as you go.\" Mr Armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium. \"In some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware, go in the opposite direction. We have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity. \"What we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories.\" Mr Gardner agreed: \"We can thrown more polygons around and have better AI but if it doesn\\'t make for a better game then that\\'s not very useful.\" Developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines, but how they employ them is still to be decided.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mystery surrounds new Yukos owner\\n\\nThe fate of Russia\\'s Yuganskneftegas - the oil firm sold to a little-known buyer on Sunday - is the subject of frantic speculation in Moscow.\\n\\nBaikal Finance Group emerged as the auction winner, agreeing to pay 260.75bn roubles (Â£4.8bn; $9.4bn). Russia\\'s newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win. The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. \"Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. The authorities have made themselves a wonderful Christmas present - Russia\\'s most efficient oil company has been destroyed,\" the Interfax news agency quoted Mr Khodorkovsky as saying via his lawyers.\\n\\nGazprom had been expected to win the auction but is thought to have failed to get finance for the deal after a US court injunction barred it from taking part. Last week, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US in a last-ditch attempt to hang on to Yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output. A US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. \"They screwed up the financing,\" said Ronald Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. \"And Gazprom doesn\\'t have this sort of money lying around.\"\\n\\nGazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase. \"It is a front for somebody but not necessarily for Gazprom,\" said Oleg Maximov, an analyst at Troika Dialog in Moscow. \"We don\\'t know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom.\\n\\n\"We tried to find it, but we couldn\\'t and as far as I know, the papers had the same result.\" The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. One scenario is that Baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting Yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of Gazprom. Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer. Menatep, Yukos main shareholders\\' group, has also threatened legal action. Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. It has been hit with more than $27bn in taxes and fines and many observers now say that the break up of the firm that accounts for 20% of Russia\\'s oil output is inevitable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Wi-fi web reaches farmers in Peru\\n\\nA network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru.\\n\\nThe pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.\\n\\nThe 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.\\n\\nThe non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. \"The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,\" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.\\n\\nOne of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. \"Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru\\'s coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,\" Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.\\n\\nCepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project\\'s success. \"Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,\" said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. \"We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives.\" So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers\\' organisations in Peru. \"This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,\" underlined Mr Saldarriaga.\\n\\nThe Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. \"It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn\\'t have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,\" recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. \"The logical answer was \\'we don\\'t sell any\\', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.\" Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.\\n',\n",
       " 'Half of UK\\'s mobiles \\'go online\\'\\n\\nMultimedia mobile phones are finally showing signs of taking off, with more Britons using them to go online.\\n\\nFigures from industry monitor, the Mobile Data Association (MDA), show the number of phones with GPRS and MMS technology has doubled since last year. GPRS lets people browse the web, access news services, mobile music and other applications like mobile chat. By the end of 2005, the MDA predicts that 75% of all mobiles in the UK will be able to access the net via GPRS. The MDA say the figures for the three months up to 30 September are a \"rapid increase\" on the figure for the same time the previous year. About 53 million people own a mobile in the UK, so the figures mean that half of those phones use GPRS. GPRS is often described as 2.5G technology - 2.5 generation - sitting between 2G and 3G technology, which is like a fast, high-quality broadband internet for phones.\\n\\nWith more services being offered by mobile operators, people are finding more reasons to go online via their mobile. Downloadable ringtones are still proving highly popular, but so is mobile chat. BandAid was the fastest ever-selling ringtone this year, according to the MDA, and chat was given some publicity when Prime Minister Tony Blair answered questions through mobile text chat. Multimedia messaging services also looked brighter with 32% of all mobiles in the UK able to send or receive picture messages. This is a 14% rise from last September\\'s figures. But a recent report from Continental Research reflects the continuing battle mobile companies have to actually persuade people to go online and to use MMS. It said that 36% of UK camera phone users had never sent a multimedia message, or MMS. That was 7% more than in 2003. Mobile companies are keen for people to use multimedia functions their phones, like sending MMS and going online, as this generates more money for them. But critics say that MMS is confusing and some mobiles are too difficult to use. There have also been some issues over interoperability, and being able to send MMS form a mobile using one network to a different one.\\n',\n",

Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge\\'s injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season.\\n\\n\"He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,\" he said. \"The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won\\'t cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday.\" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge\\'s injury. \"I don\\'t know what happened.\" he said. \"It was just a shame. I don\\'t think we even touched each other. \"By all accounts it\\'s pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best.\" Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.\\n',\n",

Hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. Rangers\\' striker Dad Prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from Craig Gordon and leaving the Hearts keeper on the ground. The SFA said: \"Once the referee\\'s report comes in then we\\'ll immediately look at things.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we\\'re well aware of what happened here. \"Prso was sent off for two cautions, and that will just be a one-match suspension.\" The SFA is certain to come down hard on Mikoliunas after Southampton\\'s David Prutton was banned for 10-games on Wednesday by the English FA for shoving referee Alan Wiley. Hearts\\' boss John Robertson said: \"Mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee\\'s chest and got a red card for it. \"The officials have got to take into account the fact he\\'s a young lad. \"But people have got to take into account why he was incensed. Why were 10,000 Hearts fans incensed? \"Why did nobody from the Rangers\\' bench claim for a penalty kick?\" Rangers\\' boss Alex McLeish accepted referee Dallas had no option but to send Prso off. McLeish said: \"I\\'m glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with Dado trying to get the ball back from Craig Gordon. \"But it was over-zealousness and I don\\'t think Hugh had any option.\"\\n',\n",

It is there, and it should be used. \"I am still trying to work out the Cueto try. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. \"We are very disappointed, and this will hurt, there is no doubt about that. \"We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.\\n\\n\"We did everything we could have done to win the game. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. \"I thought we dominated. Matt Stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop, while the likes of Charlie Hodgson, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody all came through well. \"Josh Lewsey was awesome, and every one of the forwards stood up out there. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players. \"We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but Ireland are a good side.

Chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. The move is the latest in a series of steps the Chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.\\n\\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a \"safer environment for young people in China\". Rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. The hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. China has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. The 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from October to December. China also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.\\n\\nNet cafes are hugely popular in China because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have PCs in their homes. This is not the first time that the Chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. All the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. Logs of sites people visit are also kept. Laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. During the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. In August 2004 Chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. At the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. The Reporters Without Borders group said in a report that Chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.\\n',\n",

Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz.

Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: \"I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. \"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.\"\\n\\nIn Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation\\'s commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James\\'s Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen\\'s grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets\\' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself \"the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.\\n',\n",

Richie Byrne's header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but Stevie Crawford restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by Grady just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. Tony Bullock in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. Noel Whelan laid the ball off to Jamie Winter on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. Barry Robson whipped in a free kick from the right, which Stevie Crawford caught on the volley. Russell Anderson failed to deal with it and Whelan's clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of Archibald, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when Grady tapped the ball into an empty net after Robson had headed Mark Wilson's cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of Byrne at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.\\n\\nUnited restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. Jason Scotland played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing Crawford and he coolly beat Ryan Esson from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. Grady received a pass from Crawford with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of Esson.

However, the country\\'s vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. Varig is struggling under a huge debt burden of an estimated debt of 6.5 billion reais ($2.3bn or Â£1.2bn). Asked whether a rescue was on the cards following a meeting of the country\\'s Congress to discuss the airline\\'s crisis, Mr Alencar replied: \"No, I don\\'t think so.

An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances. For that to happen Varig\\'s main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline\\'s employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. However, no jobs would be lost and the airline would keep on flying, he added. Varig, which operates in 18 countries apart from Brazil, has been driven to the brink of collapse because of the country\\'s economic downturn.\\n\\nThe depreciation of Brazil\\'s currency has had a direct impact on the airline\\'s dollar debt as well as some of its costs. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy.

Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. He became shadow chancellor under John Smith\\'s leadership in 1992. After the death of leader John Smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give Tony Blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the Granita restaurant in Islington.\\n\\nThe other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend. Mr Blair\\'s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics. During the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.\\n\\nThis dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown\\'s former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".\\n\\nIf that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. Their daughter Jennifer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. A year later, in October 2003, the couple had a son - John - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. A trip to Africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.\\n\\nThe ideological differences between Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest. The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. But their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the New Labour project. Yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with Mr Brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger Downing Street neighbour over the succession. Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute. After a recent run of negative headlines, Labour MPs took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. Events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the Brown/Blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of Westminster. How much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.\\n\\nA truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign. But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour\\'s campaign. Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader. There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can. And Mr Blair\\'s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister\\'s intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.\\n',\n",

       " 'UK broadband gets speed injection\\n\\nBroadband\\'s rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.\\n\\nAn eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online. It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV. The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BT\\'s exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.\\n\\nIt represents a \"big leap forward\" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager.\\n\\nThe service comes with a hefty Â£39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download MP3s in seconds and offers TV-quality video streaming. The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge. That represents about 4.4 million households. The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BT\\'s strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.\\n\\nThe process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog Oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular. \"The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services,\" said Mr Stening. \"It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,\" he said. Countries such as South Korea and France have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. In South Korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge. Mr Stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments. \"A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. This will basically give them 2 megabits each,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Obituary: Dame Alicia Markova\\n\\nDame Alicia Markova, who has died in Bath aged 94, was the UK\\'s first prima ballerina of the modern age, and, in her heyday, the greatest in the western world.\\n\\nShe was born Lilian Alicia Marks in London in 1910. Her parents were comfortably off - her father, a mining engineer, drove a Rolls Royce. When she was eight, her mother took a decision which changed her life. Fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs, she arranged for her to have ballet lessons. Very quickly it became apparent that she was something special. She was spotted by the Russian artistic impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, who wanted her to dance for his company, Ballets Russes. She became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch, and, eventually, with a governess in tow, joined Diaghilev in Monte Carlo when she was 14.\\n\\nFrom here, she toured Europe, playing in all the top venues. It was Diaghilev who changed her name without even consulting her. Her life was one of great excitement. People such as Matisse and Stravinsky became like uncles to her, the latter put in charge of her musical education. Soon after Diaghilev\\'s death in 1929, Alicia Markova returned to England and became Britain\\'s first international ballerina. She helped launch the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre (later the Ballet Rambert), the Vic Wells Ballet, and then, with Anton Dolin, the Markova-Dolin Ballet of 1935-37. She also began working with young choreographers such as Anthony Tudor and Frederick Ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west.\\n\\nHer version of Giselle, all lightness and grace, is still considered to be among the finest ever. She was also outstanding in The Dying Swan. She was one of the first British ballerinas to take a major part in Les Sylphides. She, above all, helped popularise ballet both in Britain and in America.\\n\\nAlicia Markova spent World War II in the United States where, in a re-formed Ballets Russes, she played to huge audiences. She even appeared in Hollywood movies. In 1950, back in England, she and Anton Dolin jointly established the Festival Ballet. She retired in 1963, an \"instant decision\" she said, \"largely because of a leg injury\". Created a Dame, she made a new career for herself as a teacher. She also travelled the world directing ballet companies and putting on shows. She became director of ballet for the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in New York, and for some years was full-time Professor of Ballet and Performing Arts in the University of Cincinnati. A critic once said of Dame Alicia Markova\\'s dancing: \"She gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground.\"\\n',\n",

Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a \"decisive blow\" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.\\n\\nHe also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to \"support us all in an ageing society\". \"Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,\" Mr Lishman said. \"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.\" In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are \"united around\" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.\\n',\n",

He added: \"Jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But I trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it.\\n\\n\"The plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on Monday we will clarify the situation.\" Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenham\\'s Premiership fixture with Charlton. \"When it comes down to personal problems, I don\\'t think we should talk about timing,\" he said. And he also denied reports that Santini had been given a Â£3m pay-off. \"That is absolute nonsense. He is the one who said \\'I will go\\' and so he went\\'\", said the Spurs sporting director. Tottenham\\'s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and Arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.\\n\\n\"I have confidence in this structure. I am confident that we have started something here in July and I still have a lot of confidence in Tottenham and what we are doing,\" he said. However, former Spurs and England defender Gary Stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift. \"I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini,\" Stevens told Five Live. \"On paper they could have worked together. But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals. \"That sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely.

Prime minister\\'s questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.\\n\\nThe Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised Â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies\\' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an Â£11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn\\'t it now clear which tax it would be?\"\\n\\nMr Blair instead hailed Labour\\'s achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. On the tax questions, he added: \"We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.\\n\\nMr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government\\'s own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: \"All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.\"\\n',\n",

He was responding to Tory spokesman Julian Lewis who said the ads were part of a wider trend of smearing the party. Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.\\n\\nA row was sparked after the party published posters appearing to depict Michael Howard, who is Jewish, as Fagin, and as a flying pig, amid claims they were anti-Semitic. The posters were labelled a \"big misjudgement\" by the Conservatives who said Labour\\'s \"first shot in the election has badly backfired\".\\n\\nThe posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who were asked to vote on their favourite. Labour has taken them off its website, saying members preferred other posters. The party\\'s four new designs, launched on Tuesday, steer clear of the Fagin or flying pig images, but make clear that Labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the Tory leader personally, with reminders of his record in office.\\n\\nThe posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour chairman Ian McCartney last year described shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin as a \"21st Century Fagin\".\\n\\n\"Given the outrage that that smear caused then, how could you have thought anything other than the fact that what you were doing in reviving it in your poster advertisements was nothing more and nothing less than a calculated campaign of sly anti-Semitism?\" Mr Milburn replied that they were not anti-Semitic. \"What they were was anti-Tory and I make no apologies at all for making clear to the British public exactly what the Conservative plans would mean,\" he said. \"I fully understand and indeed respect the views of those who have concerns about any poster designs that have appeared on the Labour Party website.\" The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labour\\'s website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5.

AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment. High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films. Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. The new network will double the world\\'s total of digital screens. Cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.\\n\\nEach film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. Fiona Deans, associate director of AADC, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.\\n\\nThe film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. \"People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. \"The picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.\"\\n\\nThe key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films, documentaries and foreign language films.\\n\\n\"Access to specialised film is currently restricted across the UK,\" said Pete Buckingham, head of Distribution and Exhibition at the UK Film Council. \"Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK,\" Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said Ms Deans. \"It can cost up to Â£1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. \"In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. \"Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.\" The UK digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. A separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in May. The sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. \"Some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don\\'t need to be shown twice a day,\" explained Ms Deans. \"A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. \"With digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.\"\\n',\n",

Japan is the biggest holder of dollar reserves in the world, with South Korea the fourth largest. The dollar was buying 104.76 yen at 0950 GMT, 0.5% stronger on the day. It also edged higher against both the euro and the pound, with one euro worth $1.3218, and one pound buying $1.9094. Concerns over rising oil prices and the outlook for the dollar pushed down US stock markets on Tuesday; the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.6%, while the Nasdaq lost 1.3%.\\n\\nThe dollar\\'s latest slide began after a South Korean parliamentary report suggested the country, which has about $200bn in foreign reserves, had plans to boost holdings of currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollar. On Wednesday, however, South Korea moved to steady the financial markets. It issued a statement that \"The Bank of Korea will not change the portfolio of currencies in its reserves due to short term market factors\". Japan, too, steadied nerves. A senior Japanese Finance Ministry official told Reuters \"we have no plans to change the composition of currency holdings in the foreign reserves, and we are not thinking about expanding our euro holdings\". Japan has $850bn in foreign exchange reserves. At the start of the year, the US currency, which had lost 7% against the euro in the final three months of 2004 and had fallen to record lows, staged something of a recovery. Analysts, however, pointed to the dollar\\'s inability recently to extend that rally despite positive economic and corporate data, and highlighted the fact that many of the US\\'s economic problems had not disappeared. The focus has been on the country\\'s massive trade and budget deficits, and analysts have predicted more dollar weakness to come.\\n',\n",

The US government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when Vice President Dick Cheney made a surprise appearance in Davos.\\n\\nUkraine\\'s new president, Viktor Yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.\\n\\nThe European Union\\'s top leaders, among them German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and European Commission President Manuel Barosso, will be here too. Mr Blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by French President Jacques Chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a \"special message\" two hours before Mr Blair speaks. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal. Mr Blair\\'s appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the UK claim it is a calculated snub against political rival Chancellor Gordon Brown, who was supposed to lead the UK government delegation.\\n\\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, the world\\'s richest man and a regular at Davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. Having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against Aids and Malaria, Mr Gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. On Tuesday, Mr Gates pledged $750m (Â£400m) of his own money to support the cause. Mr Gates\\' company, software giant Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft\\'s near monopoly on computer desktops. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil\\'s President Lula da Silva. The Brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from Microsoft to Linux. At Davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\\n',\n",

Tickets for the June event are expected to go on sale in April. \"There is only one place in the world where you will be able to get tickets,\" festival organiser Michael Eavis said. \"That will be the official source. If you get them anywhere else, you won\\'t get in.\" Fans not wanting to carry the entrance card could present their passport or driving licence instead, he added.\\n\\nMore than 153,000 people are expected to travel to Mr Eavis\\' Somerset farm from 24-26 June, but the event\\'s rising popularity has meant an extremely high demand for tickets in recent years. When the ID card idea was floated, Mr Eavis\\' daughter Emily said it would be \"quite a big step in terms of ticketing for events\" if implemented and they were \"going as far as we can\" to cut touting. \"As long as it\\'s approached in the right way, it might really work, it might really change the system,\" she said. In 2004, all 112,000 tickets for the public sold out in 24 hours. They were personalised with the names of purchasers, who were asked to bring identification, such as a driving licence, passport or household bill. But some forgot to take the right information while some touts simply offered to supply their own bills along with the ticket bearing their name. No details of this year\\'s line-up have been confirmed but rumours have suggested U2 and Coldplay may be among the headliners.\\n',\n",

The court in Washington found that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. In its case, the government claimed tobacco firms manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction, targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns, lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.\\n\\nProsecutors wanted the cigarette firms to surrender $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. But the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the US government could not sue the firms under legislation drawn up to counteract Mafia infiltration of business. The tobacco companies deny that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. They also say they have already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. Shares of tobacco companies closed higher after the ruling, with Altria rising 5% and Reynolds showing gains of 4.5%.\\n\",\n",
       " 'No seasonal lift for house market\\n\\nA swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the UK property market.\\n\\nThe Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), British Bankers Association (BBA) and Building Societies Association (BSA) all said mortgage lending was slowing. CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell. Elsewhere, the BBA added underlying mortgage lending rose by Â£4m in November, compared to October\\'s Â£4.29m. The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.\\n\\nData from the CML showed lending fell to just over Â£25bn in November, from Â£25.5bn a year earlier. Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted Â£2.98bn. The figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a \"winter sale\" and slash prices by up to 8%. Miles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove, said sellers would have to be \"more realistic with their asking prices\" to tempt buyers. The average asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in November to Â£189,733 in December, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.\\n\\nRightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. \"Even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. In any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,\" Mr Shipside said.\\n\\n\"The proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market.\" Overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their July peaks as the equivalent of Â£6,500 has been cut from an average property. A host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. \"What is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,\" CML director general Michael Coogan said. \"It\\'s a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,\" Investec economist Philip Shaw said. \"However, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.\"\\n',\n",

The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports. BAA, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. \"We are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,\" a BAA spokesman said.\\n\\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. The company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. Among other measures, BAA has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near Stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.\\n\\nAt Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. Stop Stansted Expansion said the White Paper, published in December 2003, was \"fundamentally flawed\" and did not follow the proper consultation process. \"We do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government White Paper,\" said Stop Stansted Expansion chairman Peter Sanders said. HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare. \"It hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. \"Yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. \" A judgement from Mr Justice Sullivan is expected early in February.\\n',\n",

The rest of the world should listen,\" the prime minister said in an interview with The Times newspaper, published on Friday. Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda. French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity. Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.\\n\\nHe said some people were in \"a sort of state of denial\" about the US election result but predicted a more \"receptive mood\" would emerge soon. America needed to listen to the world too, he said. \"The fact is that President Bush is there for four years. He is there because the American people have chosen him,\" he argued. He also made clear he intended to take seriously what he perceives as his role in bringing the two continents together.\\n\\nBritain was \"uniquely placed\" to make out the common ground because of its strong alliance with the US, he suggested. He admitted he had gone to bed at 2230GMT, well before the American polls closed, thinking Mr Kerry might have won. He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result. His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac. The French president told reporters: \"Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity. \"That is the goal of the constitution in a world that is more multi-polar than ever.\"\\n\\nMr Chirac will miss an address to the summit from Iraqi interim leader Iyad Allawi, who this week criticised nations which took a \"spectator\" role to Iraq\\'s reconstruction. Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates\\' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi. He also signed a communiqu&#233; stressing the EU\\'s commitment to securing a stable and unified Iraq. The EU also confirmed a new $21m aid package. The communiqu&#233; congratulated President Bush on his victory and stressed the importance of good transatlantic relations. The summit is also expected to agree changes to streamline European asylum and immigration decisions. Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto. The meeting will also assess progress on the economic reform plans agreed in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe more competitive.\\n',\n",

GM, whose own European operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable Fiat unit. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday\\'s 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (Â£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. It has argued the deal was voided by Fiat\\'s decision to sell off Fiat\\'s finance arm and halve GM\\'s stake via a capital-raising effort.\\n\\nThe 2000 deal resulted from a race between GM and DaimlerChrysler to ally with Fiat. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM\\'s offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a \"put option\". Since then, however, Fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut GM\\'s stake in half to 10%.

Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.\\n\\nFurther details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. \"This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,\" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\\n\\nThe FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA\\'s 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called \"magic circle\", in the hope of propping up one another\\'s share prices.\\n\\nFirms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to Â£350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.\\n',\n",

Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.\\n\\nPreviously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. Policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. As a result, NCCI is being developed as the industry's flagship firm - publicly-listed, with audited accounts.

Some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the World Bank and the IMF, he said. But the US says it cannot support Mr Brown\\'s International Finance Facility to boost aid to developing countries. BBC correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the UK\\'s ambitions, but much work was needed. Mr Brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - \"the vast bulk\" of money owed by the poorest countries.\\n\\n\"We could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,\" he said. He added: \"It is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor.\" But he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. BBC correspondent Patrick Bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. Oxfam senior policy adviser Max Lawson welcomed the statement and said G7 ministers had \"passed the first hurdle of 2005\".\\n\\nBut he added: \"They need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world\\'s poorest. \"Two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in April. If rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly.\" Talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in April. Mr Brown said G7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. But UK plans for an International Finance Facility (IFF) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. Mr Brown wanted to provide $10bn (Â£5.38bn) a year over a decade, using G7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.\\n\\nIt is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the Marshall Plan, which brought US aid to rebuild Europe after World War II, for the developing world. Mr Brown said it was \"winning support every day\" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the G8 summit in July. But US Treasury Under-Secretary John Taylor said the US could not support the IFF because of its \"legislative process\". \"The US is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,\" he said. \"But this particular mechanism does not work for the United States. It works for other countries, and that is fine.\" Earlier, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme the US had increased support for Africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. But South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told the BBC\\'s Talking Point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. He said much of the money pledged by the US had not yet been dispensed.\\n\\nThe UK has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the Group of Eight (G8), which comprises the G7 and Russia. The G8 countries will meet at Gleneagles in Scotland. At a dinner on Friday night, former South African president Nelson Mandela backed Mr Brown\\'s plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off African debt and provide an extra $50bn (Â£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. Talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of China and India, the US budget and trade deficits, how the US, Europe and Japan can act to boost global economic growth, and HIV/Aids. G7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said \"excess volatility\" would impede economic growth. Representatives from China, India, Russia, South Africa and Brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. A G8 summit is set to take place in July.\\n',\n",

Every officer had an annual target of 8,000 applications - equivalent to 40 a day or one every 11 minutes. MPs want research into whether UK visa holders leave at the end of their stays, or vanish into the black market. Committee chairman Edward Leigh said: \"There is a worrying tension between quick processing and proper control over the visas issued. \"Entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. \"\\n\\nThe committee\\'s report also discussed the Romanian and Bulgarian visas scandal which led to the resignation of immigration minister Beverley Hughes last year. Committee members said the Home Office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. Investigations carried out in the wake of Ms Hughes\\' resignation found more than 7,000 people had entered the UK under the business visa scheme for Romanian and Bulgarian \"entrepreneurs\". Mr Leigh said the Home Office should now consider removing those who had not set up a valid business. A Home Office spokesman said the system had been toughened and tightened since the investigation. He added \"that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre-entry applications will be replaced by a single pre-entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system\".\\n',\n",

Andre 3000 and Big Boi\\'s album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair\\'s year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all?\\n\\nG Money, a presenter on the BBC\\'s urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. \"They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. \"Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,\" says the DJ.\\n\\n\"But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. \"Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. We haven\\'t seen the last of them,\" he adds. OutKast\\'s musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum. But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US.\\n\\n1Xtra\\'s G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be \"assured of their genius\". \"They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasn\\'t,\" he adds. But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough. \"What can you do next when you\\'ve done it all?\" he says. With ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame, it seems that OutKast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry.\\n',\n",

It\\'s definitely part of me but who knows whether, if or when I\\'ll be playing there again.\" Owen, who moved to the Bernabeu from Liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for Real but has been unable to replace Raul or Ronaldo in the starting line-up. However, he said he was delighted with the way his time in Spain was going and dismissed criticism of his decision to join Real. \"When I first came there was a lot of scepticism back in England, any maybe some out here,\" he said. \"People were saying \\'fourth-choice striker, what are you going there for? You\\'ll be sat on the bench all the time\\'.\\n\\n\"But as much as our press like to build it up as if I\\'ve permanently had my backside on the bench, I\\'ve played as many games as anyone else in the team this year. \"For a fourth-choice striker at the start I\\'m more than happy with the way I\\'ve settled in.\" Recent speculation has linked Owen with a move back to England, with Newcastle expressing their interest, but the England striker said he is not ready to return home. He added: \"I\\'ve got nothing against the Premiership, I mean that\\'s where I first performed, that\\'s where I made my name.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t keep my eyes off the Premiership on television when I\\'m at home.\" When asked if it would have to be Liverpool if he returned Owen said: \"I\\'ve not really given it much thought. \"I\\'ve got great memories of Liverpool. No matter what happens it\\'ll always be a club I have fond memories of and it will always have a place in my heart. \"It\\'s very flattering to be linked to top clubs in England - I\\'m glad that no-one is forgetting me! \"But I couldn\\'t have wished for a better start in Madrid.\"\\n\\n- Listen to the full interview with Garry Richardson on BBC Radio Five Live\\'s Sportsweek at 0900 GMT on Sunday.\\n',\n",

Lightbody said \"over the last 18 months touring has taken its toll on the rest of the band\\'s relationship with him\". He said: \"This is the hardest decision we have ever had to make and believe us when we say we didn\\'t make it lightly.\" The group, originally from Northern Ireland, has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single Run and award-winning album Final Straw. In a statement on the band\\'s website, Lightbody said: \"I started the group with Mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of Snow Patrol and my life throughout that decade.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"It got to the stage that things couldn\\'t go on as they were, so we felt there was no other course of action but this. \"I know you will all be distressed and may not understand this news but we had to do what was best for the band.\" Snow Patrol are currently working on the follow-up to their breakthrough third album. The band is set to play support to U2 on a number of summer stadium gigs. Last month, they were the big winners in Ireland\\'s top music honours, the Meteor Awards, picking up accolades for best band and album.

       " 'US industrial output growth eases\\n\\nUS industrial production continued to rise in November, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.\\n\\nThe US Federal Reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% - in line with forecasts - from a revised 0.6% increase in October. Analysts added that if the carmaking sector - which saw production fall 0.5% - had been excluded the data would have been more impressive. The latest increase means industrial output has grown 4.2% in the past year. Many analysts were upbeat about the prospects for the US economy, with the increase in production coming on the heels of news of a recovery in retail sales. \"This is very consistent with an economy growing at 3.5 to 4.0%. It is congruent with job growth and consumer optimism,\" Comerica chief economist David Littman said of the figures.\\n\\nThe US economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between July and September, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period. While the employment figures are not spectacular, experts believe they are enough to whittle away at America\\'s 5.4% jobless rate. A breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%. But utility output dropped 1.4%. Meanwhile, the amount of factory capacity in use during the month rose to 77.6% - its highest level since May 2001. \"Many investors think that product market inflation won\\'t be a problem until the utilisation rates are at 80% or higher,\" Cary Leahy, senior US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said. \"So there is still a lot of inflation-fighting slack in the manufacturing sector,\" \"Overall I\\'d say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and I would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are,\" Citigroup senior economist Steven Wieting added.\\n',\n",
       " 'Can Yahoo dominate next decade?\\n\\nYahoo has reached the grand old age of 10 and, in internet years, that is a long time.\\n\\nFor many, Yahoo remains synonymous with the internet - a veteran that managed to ride the dot-com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web\\'s top brands. But for others there is another, newer net icon threatening to overshadow Yahoo in the post dot-com world - Google.\\n\\nThe veteran and the upstart have plenty in common - Yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and Google was arguably the most watched IPO (Initial Public Offering) of the post-dot-com era. Both began life as search engines although in 2000, when Yahoo chose Google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business, it was very much Yahoo that commanded press attention. In recent years, the column inches have stacked up in Google\\'s favour as the search engine also diversifies with the launch of services such as Gmail, its shopping channel Froogle and Google News.\\n\\nFor Jupiter analyst Olivier Beauvillain, Yahoo\\'s initial decision to put its investment on search on hold was an error. \"Yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to Google,\" he said \"They thought Google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor,\" he added. He believes Yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users, something it has rediscovered in recent years. \"It is interesting that in these last few years, it has refocused on search following the success of Google,\" he said. But for Allen Weiner, a research director at analyst firm Gartner and someone who has followed Yahoo\\'s progress since the early years, the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it. \"Search technology is valuable but the next generation of search is going to be about premium content and the interface that users have to that content,\" he said. He believes the rivalry between Google and Yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between Yahoo and MSN. It is a battle that Yahoo is currently winning, he believes. \"Microsoft has amazing assets including software capability and a global name but it has yet to show me it can create a rival product to Yahoo,\" he said.\\n\\nHe is convinced Yahoo remains the single most important brand on the world wide web.\\n\\n\"I believe Yahoo is the seminal brand on the web. If you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then Yahoo is it,\" he said. It has achieved this dominance, Mr Weiner believes, by a canny combination of acquisitions such as that of Inktomi and Overture, and by avoiding direct involvement in either content creation or internet access. That is not to say that Yahoo hasn\\'t had its dark days. When the dot-com bubble burst, it lost one-third of its revenue in a single year, bore a succession of losses and saw its market value fall from a peak of $120bn to $4.6bn at one point. Crucial to its survival was the decision to replace chief executive Tim Koogle with Terry Semel in May 2001, thinks Mr Weiner. His business savvy, coupled with the technical genius of founder Jerry Yang has proved a winning combination, he says.\\n\\nSo as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor, how will it fare as it enters its teenage years? \"The game is theirs to lose and MSN is the only one that stands in the way of Yahoo\\'s domination,\" predicted Mr Weiner. Nick Hazel, Yahoo\\'s head of consumer services in the UK, thinks the fact that Yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. Search will be a key focus as will making Yahoo Messenger available on mobiles, forging new broadband partnerships such as that with BT in the UK and continuing to provide a range of services beyond the desktop, he says. Mr Weiner thinks Yahoo\\'s vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access. \"It will spread its portal wings to expand into rich media,\" he predicts.\\n',\n",
       " \"Chelsea denied by James heroics\\n\\nA brave defensive display, led by keeper David James, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea.\\n\\nAfter a quiet opening, James denied Damien Duff, Jiri Jarosik and Mateja Kezman, while Paul Bosvelt cleared William Gallas' header off the line. Robbie Fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but James kept out Frank Lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. Shaun Wright-Phillips - watched by England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by John Terry. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, Duff got round Ben Thatcher and blasted in a shot that James parried to Kezman, who turned the ball wide.\\n\\nSoon afterwards, Jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head Lampard's corner goalwards but James tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and James kept out Kezman's fierce drive before Bosvelt and James combined to clear Gallas' header from Duff's corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in Fowler celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. Wright-Phillips raced down the left and crossed to Fowler but City's lone man up front, left free by Terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. The second half started as quietly as the first, although James was forced to divert a cross from the lively Duff away from Eidur Gudjohnsen's path. There was a nasty moment for Petr Cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw Fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which Duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by Bosvelt. Lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and James somehow blocked it with his legs. Another timely challenge, this time from Richard Dunne in time added on, prevented Gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. There was still time for James to produce a sensational save to tip Lampard's volley round the post.\\n\\nCech, Paulo Ferreira, Gallas, Terry, Bridge, Jarosik (Tiago 56), Lampard, Makelele, Duff, Gudjohnsen, Kezman (Cole 63).\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Johnson, Smertin, Cudicini.\\n\\nMakelele, Gudjohnsen.\\n\\nJames, Mills, Distin, Dunne, Thatcher, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Bosvelt, Barton, Sibierski (McManaman 85), Musampa, Fowler.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Macken, Weaver, Onuoha, Jordan.\\n\\nBosvelt.\\n\\n42,093\\n\\nH Webb (S Yorkshire).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Blair rejects Tory terror offer\\n\\nTony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.\\n\\nThe Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.\\n\\nThe government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.\\n\\nMr Blair\\'s refusal to accept the Tories\\' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.\\n\\nThe Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four\\'s the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don\\'t get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.\\n\\nThe second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by \"an eminent and independent person\". \"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,\" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"There\\'s a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a \"basic principle\" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: \"Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.\"\\n',\n",

Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.\\n\\nIn its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.\\n\\nBut it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. Deloitte\\'s chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: \"The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"\\n\\nEconomic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of England to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,\" Mr Bootle.\\n',\n",

       " 'German economy rebounds\\n\\nGermany\\'s economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.\\n\\nGross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. Concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. It is the nineteenth month in a row that the ECB has not moved borrowing costs. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\\n\\n\"During 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said Stefan Schilbe, analyst at HSBC Trinkaus & Burkhardt. \"If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" Many German consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment.

Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Child access law shake-up planned\\n\\nParents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.\\n\\nCurfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers\\' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC \"there is a recognition that something is wrong\". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.\\n\\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:\\n\\n- Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past \\n - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases \\n - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet \\n - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.\\n\\nJudges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child\\'s interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a \"medium range\" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.\\n\\nFailure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: \"Tagging may be going too far, but let\\'s have a debate about that.\" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published \"in the next two weeks,\" a spokesman said.\\n\\nThe government\\'s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers\\' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.\" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".\\n\\n\"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. \"Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart.\" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children\\'s Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.\\n\\nThe Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the government\\'s plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\". She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\". \"We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,\" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up \"like property\" when a marriage collapses.

Consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size, onboard memory or the chip inside, shows an in-depth study by handset maker Ericsson. \"Historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said Dr Michael Bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at Ericsson\\'s consumer and enterprise lab. \"We have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives,\" he said. \"We should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nFor the study, Ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone. \"People\\'s habits remain the same,\" said Dr Bjorn. \"They just move the activity into the mobile phone as it\\'s a much more convenient way to do it.\"\\n\\nOne good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said. While diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form. Youngsters\\' use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way. Dr Bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles. Ericsson\\'s research has shown that consumers divide into different \"tribes\" that use phones in different ways. Dr Bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use. \"For instance,\" he said, \"older people are using SMS much more than they did five years ago.\" This was because younger users, often the children of ageing mobile owners, encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch.\\n\\nAnother factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists. Only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.\\n\\nOnce this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off. Dr Bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in Japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop. However, he said, now 45% of the Japanese people Ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month. In 2003 the figure was 29%. Similarly, across Europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise. In 2003 only 4% of the people in the UK took a phonecam snap at least once a month. Now the figure is 14%. Similar rises have been seen in many other European nations. Dr Bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras. \"Usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras,\" he said. Digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings, holidays and birthdays. By contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.\\n',\n",

       " 'More power to the people says HP\\n\\nThe digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to Carly Fiorina, chief of technology giant Hewlett Packard.\\n\\nThe job of firms such as HP now, she said in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. She said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. CES showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. The tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 January. \"The digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,\" she told delegates. \"Revolution has always been about giving power to the people.\" She added: \"The real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell.\" Part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. Crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. A lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.\\n\\nMs Fiorina\\'s talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.\\n\\nSpecial guest, singer Gwen Stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of HP digital cameras which Ms Stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by Japanese youth culture. The digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the US by the summer, are based on the HP 607 model. The emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year\\'s CES, with tiny, wearable MP3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. Ms Fiorina also announced that HP was working with Nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in Europe early this year. The service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track\\'s ringtone, simultaneously. The service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.\\n\\nAmong the other new products she showcased was the Digital Media Hub, a big upgrade to HP\\'s Digital Entertainment Centre. Coming out in the autumn in the US, the box is a networked, high-definition TV, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and DVD recorder. It has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and Light Scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised DVD labels and covers. It is designed to contain all a household\\'s digital media, such as pre-recorded TV shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. The hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the PC so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. Research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. Eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. Media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. Ms Fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included Microsoft chief Bill Gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. In a separate announcement during the keynote speech, Ms Fiorina said that HP would be partnering MTV to replace this year\\'s MTV Asia music award. MTV\\'s Asia Aid will be held in Bangkok on 3 February, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the Asian tsunami disaster.\\n',\n",
       " 'Amnesty chief laments war failure\\n\\nThe lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups, Amnesty International\\'s chief has said.\\n\\nIn a lecture at the London School of Economics, Irene Khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 September, 2001. She said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message. And it had to fight poverty, not just focus on political rights for elites.\\n\\nMs Khan highlighted detentions without trial, including those at the US camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems. \"What\\'s a new challenge is the way in which this age-old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war,\" she said. \"By using the language of war, human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war.\" Ms Khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world. \"The human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights,\" she said. That was accompanied by a crisis of governance, where the United Nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account.\\n\\nThe Amnesty secretary-general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism. \"Public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups,\" she said. Ms Khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system. There needed to be a drive to use simpler language, talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes. Such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world, she said.\\n\\nThe human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments. Al-Qaeda, for example, was not going to be impressed by a traditional Amnesty letter writing campaign. More also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations. Amnesty International members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation\\'s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too. Ms Khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife. \"We would be an elitist bunch working for the elites, for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read,\" she said. Despite her concerns, Ms Khan dubbed herself a \"hope-monger\", saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges.\\n',\n",

But, despite missing forecasts of 53.7, the PMI number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. The CIPS said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high.\\n\\nThe survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. That triggered the second successive monthly fall in the CIPS employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since June 2003. The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam. \"It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again,\" said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva. \"You have weakness in manufacturing, which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England.\"\\n',\n",

However, Deutsche Boerse told Reuters: \"TCI\\'s request for the removal of the supervisory board will be considered at the annual general meeting on May 25.\"\\n\\nThe Sunday Times reported that TCI had been drawing up a list of heavyweight executives to replace Deutsche\\'s chairman Rolf Breuer and chief executive Werner Seifert. The group owns more than 5% of Deutsche - more than enough to demand an extraordinary general meeting to call on shareholders to oust the German exchange\\'s management. Under German law Deutsche does not need investor backing to make a takeover bid. TCI and Atticus have opposed the LSE bid for some time saying it would destroy shareholder value, and would be better spent on a share buyback. Deutsche is in competition with pan-European bourse Euronext to take over the London exchange. Many commentators have suggested a bidding war between the two could break out.

       " 'UKIP MEP attacked German \\'empire\\'\\n\\nA UK Independence Party MEP suggested Germany saw the EU as an \\'empire\\' and was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed. Mike Nattrass, UKIP\\'s deputy leader, made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last September\\'s Hartlepool by-election campaign. But challenged on the remark, he denied accusing Germany of using the EU as cover for a \"4th German Reich\". He says he was not \"German-bashing\" but saying peace was the EU\\'s founding aim. The meeting was shown in a BBC 3 film on ex-UKIP MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk. The former chat show host quit the party earlier this month, calling it a joke.\\n\\nThe documentary showed Mr Nattrass, apparently talking about the EU, telling the meeting: \"The Germans are the big losers here but they don\\'t care because to them the project is worthwhile. \"It\\'s like an empire for them spreading in all directions away from Germany into Hungary, into what they call the Sudetenland - Czechoslovakia, places like that. \"So it\\'s cheaper for them to do it this way than roll the tanks in.\" On Tuesday, he told the BBC News website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with MEPs of different nationalities in the European Parliament. He argued that peace was the only reason for having the \"outdated\" EU as there was no economic justification. Pointing to Germany\\'s trade interests as a country in the centre of Europe, Mr Nattrass said: \"The fact is that the EU benefits Germany but it does not benefit Britain. \"I\\'m not at all German-bashing. It\\'s the truth.\" A UKIP spokesman said: \"Mike has some passionate beliefs and sometimes uses excessively colourful language with which to express them.\"\\n\\nThe documentary showed some of the tensions between Mr Kilroy-Silk and his fellow MEPs after UKIP took third place in last year\\'s European elections. He denied wanting to be leader until October 2004, when he told BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost programme he aspired to the job. Asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, Mr Kilroy-Silk said: \"There was one thing I said that I shouldn\\'t have said at the time. \"I was trying to be helpful to the party and it was the wrong thing to do, I should have told the truth.\" The film also included footage of a row between Mr Kilroy-Silk, MEP Nigel Farage and party leader Roger Knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the UKIP whip in the European Parliament. Mr Kilroy-Silk told them he had not left the UKIP group - a move he announced shortly after the meeting. He told Mr Farage: \"Don\\'t tell lies Nigel, now you\\'ve told too many. Most of the trouble had been caused by you.\" UKIP officials claim it was in fact Mr Kilroy-Silk, not Mr Farage, who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of MEPs.\\n\\nLater in unguarded, off-air comments in a television studio, Mr Kilroy-Silk was heard saying he was irritated by \"defending some of these right-wing fascist nutters\". Mr Kilroy-Silk separately said he had argued against UKIP working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin. A UKIP spokesman said there were more than 40 MEPs in the same group in the European Parliament. They were from a broad spectrum - some right-wing, some left-wing - but with a shared belief in the \"unfeasibility of the EU as it is now\". He did not defend other groups\\' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states. London UKIP MEP Gerard Batten said: \"Robert has made a variety of comments about UKIP and its MEPs. \"There are of course two sides to every story. What Robert does not say is that he was offered several positions which would have given him effective control of the party, but not the title of leader.\" Mr Kilroy-Silk is to launch his own parry, Veritas, in Westminster on Wednesday.\\n',\n",
       " 'China keeps tight rein on credit\\n\\nChina\\'s efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.\\n\\nThe curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. Growth in China remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. Rapid tooling-up of China\\'s manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. A low exchange rate - China\\'s yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. To some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. Industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to October, down from 23% in February, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\\n',\n",
       " 'Online games play with politics\\n\\nAfter bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.\\n\\nThe US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean. More than 20 followed suit, including Frontrunner, eLections, President Forever and The Political Machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media. Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate\\'s virtues or his vices.\\n\\nThe phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.\\n\\n\"When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,\" said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen. \"I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,\" added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns. Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. The aim is to comment on international news events via games.\\n\\nThe ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.\\n\\n\"Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,\" Mr Frasca told the BBC News website. This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country\\'s problems could be solved by working together. \"It\\'s up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games.\" Ultimately, Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs. \"Children learn a lot about the world through play. There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.\"\\n\\nBut experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.\\n\\nThis is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. Dr Frasca said: \"Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them.\" \"It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Bank opts to leave rates on hold\\n\\nThe Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.\\n\\nThe Bank\\'s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month\\'s economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week\\'s inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.\\n\\nSlower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.\\n\\nAnd recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".\\n\\nBusiness groups welcomed the MPC\\'s widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said David Frost, BCC director general. \"Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"\\n',\n",

The pair were locked together for the last few miles before Radcliffe finally sprinted clear to win in two hours, 23 minutes and 10 seconds. \"It\\'s a good way to end the year,\" she said. \"I\\'m ready for a good rest now.\" Radcliffe decided only recently to run in the race and many had doubted whether she had sufficiently recovered from her Olympic ordeal just 11 weeks ago. But the world record-holder was prominent at the head of the field for the whole race as her rivals slowly dropped off the pace. Just Chepkemei and Radcliffe were left in contention as the race came into the final few miles. The Kenyan put in several bursts of speed to throw off Radcliffe but the Briton managed to hang in. Both runners looked to be suffering as they reached the final mile in Central Park.

England\\'s acting head coach Andy Robinson said: \"He is a natural leader, holds the respect of the squad and is a formidable talent on the pitch. \"And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England.\" Robinson added: \"There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. \"Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson.\\n\\n\"But I am confident Jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next Rugby World Cup in France and I look forward to working with him.\" Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England\\'s 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. \"It\\'s the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,\" he said. \"I\\'m honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years.\\n\\n\"Getting my first England cap against Ireland six years ago was something I\\'ll never forget because to play for your country is very special.

In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\\n',\n",

It\\'s just that I don\\'t want to make this story bigger than it is.\" Wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old Spaniard, who was signed last summer from Celta Vigo as back-up to Jens Lehmann.\\n\\n\"If you look at my career, you will see that I have left many big players out for a long time. I\\'ve done it with Dennis Bergkamp, Kanu, everybody. \"It\\'s because it\\'s a goalkeeper, that\\'s all. It\\'s a usual situation for me. You put your best team out, no matter who it is. \"For me, it was not a big mistake at Old Trafford and I wasn\\'t alarmed by what happened against Birmingham either. \"It\\'s nothing against Lehmann. I think he\\'s a great keeper, as is Almunia. You can only play one of them. \"These people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. Just because Lehmann doesn\\'t play for two or three weeks, or longer or shorter, it doesn\\'t mean I\\'ve lost faith in him.\"\\n\\nBut former Arsenal keeper David Seaman believes Lehmann has been harshly treated. Seaman told the Daily Mail: \"Jens is a fantastic keeper. He deserves another chance. \"He has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice.\" With Arsenal hit by injuries and suspension, inexperienced midfield pair of Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas will line up against Rosenborg but Wenger is confident they will prove more than capable. \"It puts a lot of pressure on them but it\\'s a good learning process,\" said Wenger. \"I\\'m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate.\"\\n\\nThe Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal. Campbell said: \"It means a lot to me to go through, it\\'s everything. We want to carry on in this competition. \"That\\'s where the best teams in Europe are. To be in there, playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy, is the first thing in my mind.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League. Henry will captain the side in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira as the Gunners seek the required victory over Rosenborg. And the striker said: \"If we don\\'t win and we go out of the competition, like it or not, it\\'s going to be my fault. That\\'s the way it is. \"If the team don\\'t win I know I will be criticised, no matter how I play.\"\\n',\n",

Mr Fuller has been appointed to the CFX board and will plan and implement the company\\'s creative strategy. The 19 firm handles a roster of music artists, TV shows and PR strategies for stars including the Beckhams. The deal sees Mr Fuller receive Â£64.5m in cash and about 1.9 million shares in Sports Entertainment. There will also be a further Â£19.2m in either cash or stocks by the end of the financial year in June. Mr Fuller has signed a long-term agreement with the company which will see him continue to expand and develop entertainment brands. He said: \"This is a hugely exciting new partnership for myself and 19 Entertainment.\\n\\n\"CKX will provide 19 with a powerful platform for global growth and allow us to fully take advantage of all the amazing opportunities that lie ahead. I cannot wait to get started.\"\\n\\nMr Fuller was the creative drive behind Pop Idol and its US offspring American Idol. 19 Management runs the careers of many of its successful contestants including Will Young, Gareth Gates and Kelly Clarkson. The company was set up 15 years ago by Mr Fuller, taking the name from his first successful single - 19 by Paul Hardcastle. Fuller was the driving force behind the Spice Girls phenomenon, using canny marketing and catchy pop songs to secure their place as the most lucrative girl group in history. He then put together S Club 7, who had their own TV show as well as a music career. Mr Sillerman\\'s deal to buy the Presley estate sees him control the operation of Graceland, as well as money from the late star\\'s music and films. Presley\\'s daughter Lisa Marie retains possession of Graceland and many of her father\\'s \"personal effects\".\\n',\n",

Coming back to rugby, people said \\'you are dreaming\\' but it always starts off with a dream. \"It\\'s up to you whether you want to make it a reality.\" Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: \"As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. \"There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don\\'t know it. \"I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].\" At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. \"The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,\" he added. \"I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. \"To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Japan\\'s ageing workforce: built to last\\n\\nIn his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.\\n\\nMr Toshitsune is one of Japan\\'s 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. Between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: \"Well, what\\'s most important for me is to be Japan\\'s number one.\" Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans.\\n\\nOn the outskirts of Kyoto, 83-year-old Yuji Shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.\\n\\n\"I think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,\" he remarks. \"On average, we can live longer.\" Whether it\\'s the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, Japan\\'s elderly are remarkable. But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan is the world\\'s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.\\n\\nBy 2007, Japan\\'s population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. This means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.\\n\\n\"In the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,\" explains Shigeo Morioka of the International Longevity Centre in Tokyo. So how will Japan\\'s finances stay on track? After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country\\'s gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan\\'s welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. Glen Wood, Vice President of Deutsche Securities Japan, asks; \"Who\\'s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new Japanese worker? \"Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Who are going to be the producers of the GDP going forward?\" One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.\\n\\nStanding next to Tokyo harbour is a version of New York\\'s Statue of Liberty. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island.\\n\\n\"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it\\'s an option that\\'s becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists Mr Wood. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. But for the Japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.\\n\\nOf course the Japanese could always have more children. The government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in Australia. But there would be no pay back until 2030, when today\\'s babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in Europe, starts to unfold in 2010. In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. Although President Bush must re-devise Social Security to take account of a 130% rise in America\\'s over 65s, the IMF foresees a positive contribution to the US current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.\\n\\nSome voices in Japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the Japanese labour market. They want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country\\'s ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,\" says Mr Wood. Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. Falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. There are fears that the world\\'s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. But none of this is Mr Toshitsune\\'s concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.\\n',\n",
       " 'BT program to beat dialler scams\\n\\nBT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands.\\n\\nFrom May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user\\'s \"pre-approved list\". Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on. Thousands of UK dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam. Some people have faced phone bills of up to Â£2,000. BT\\'s Modem Protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved, such as national and net service provider numbers. Icstis, the UK\\'s premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives. \"The initiatives are very welcome,\" a spokesperson from Icstis told the BBC News website. \"We are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers.\"\\n\\nThe second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills. If a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average, or if a call is made to a suspect number, a text or voice alert will be sent to the user\\'s landline phone. As part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers, companies must now satisfy stringent conditions, including clear terms and conditions, information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds. Any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by Icstis. The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services.\\n\\nThere are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem. It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams. \"We now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers, who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves,\" said Gavin Patterson, group managing director for consumer the arm of BT. Both schemes have been undergoing trials in Ireland, and will be made available to 20 million BT customers from May.\\n',\n",

Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter. Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday. However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor. \"Long-term growth drivers of the industry remain solid,\" Ericsson said in a statement.\\n\\nChief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg explained that about \"27% of the world\\'s population now has access to mobile communications\". \"This is exciting for a company with a vision of an all-communicating world,\" he added.

       " \"England 17-18 France\\n\\nEngland suffered an eighth defeat in 11 Tests as scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili booted France to victory at Twickenham.\\n\\nTwo converted tries from Olly Barkley and Josh Lewsey helped the world champions to a 17-6 half-time lead. But Charlie Hodgson and Barkley missed six penalties between them, while Yachvili landed six for France to put the visitors in front. England could have won the game with three minutes left, but Hodgson pushed an easy drop goal opportunity wide. It was a dismal defeat for England, coming hard on the heels of an opening Six Nations loss in Wales. They should have put the game well beyond France's reach, but remarkably remained scoreless for the entire second half. A scrappy opening quarter saw both sides betray the lack of confidence engendered by poor opening displays against Wales and Scotland respectively. Hodgson had an early opportunity to settle English nerves but pushed a straightforward penalty attempt wide. But a probing kick from France centre Damien Traille saw Mark Cueto penalised for holding on to the ball in the tackle, Yachvili giving France the lead with a kick from wide out.\\n\\nFrance twice turned over England ball at the breakdown early on as the home side struggled to generate forward momentum, one Ben Kay charge apart. A spell of tit-for-tat kicking emphasised the caution on both sides, until England refused a possible three points to kick a penalty to the corner, only to botch the subsequent line-out. But England made the breakthrough after 19 minutes, when a faltering move off the back of a scrum led to the opening try. Jamie Noon took a short pass from Barkley and ran a good angle to plough through Yann Delaigue's flimsy tackle before sending his centre partner through to score at the posts.\\n\\nHodgson converted and added a penalty after one of several French infringements on the floor for a 10-3 lead. The fly-half failed to dispense punishment though with a scuffed attempt after France full-back Pepito Elhorga, scragged by Lewsey, threw the ball into touch. Barkley also missed two longer-range efforts as the first half drew to a close, but by then England had scored a second converted try. After a series of phases lock Danny Grewcock ran hard at the French defence and off-loaded out of Sylvain Marconnet's tackle to Lewsey. The industrious wing cut back in on an angle and handed off hooker Sebastien Bruno to sprint over. After a dire opening to the second half, France threw on three forward replacements in an attempt to rectify the situation, wing Jimmy Marlu having already departed injured. Yachvili nibbled away at the lead with a third penalty after 51 minutes.\\n\\nAnd when Lewis Moody was twice penalised - for handling in a ruck and then straying offside - the scrum-half's unerring left boot cut the deficit to two points. Barkley then missed his third long-range effort to increase the tension. And after seeing another attempt drop just short, Yachvili put France ahead with his sixth penalty with 11 minutes left.\\n\\nEngland sent on Ben Cohen and Matt Dawson, and after Barkley's kick saw Christophe Dominici take the ball over his own line, the stage was set for a victory platform. But even after a poor scrummage, Hodgson had the chance to seal victory but pushed his drop-goal attempt wide. England threw everything at the French in the final frantic moments, but the visitors held on for their first win at Twickenham since 1997.\\n\\nJ Robinson (capt); M Cueto, J Noon, O Barkley, J Lewsey; C Hodgson, H Ellis; G Rowntree, S Thompson, P Vickery; D Grewcock, B Kay; J Worsley, L Moody, M Corry.\\n\\nA Titterrell, A Sheridan, S Borthwick, A Hazell, M Dawson, H Paul, B Cohen.\\n\\nP Elhorga; C Dominici, B Liebenberg, D Traille, J Marlu; Y Delaigue, D Yachvili; S Marconnet, S Bruno, N Mas; F Pelous (capt), J Thion, S Betsen, J Bonnaire, S Chabal.\\n\\nW Servat, J Milloud, G Lamboley, Y Nyanga, P Mignoni, F Michalak, J-P Grandclaude.\\n\\nPaddy O'Brien (New Zealand)\\n\",\n",
       " 'Gerrard happy at Anfield\\n\\nLiverpool captain Steven Gerrard has reiterated his desire to stay at Anfield and win trophies with the club.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old England midfielder is determined to see out his contract, despite reported interest from Chelsea. He said: \"I\\'m signed here for this season and another two so there is no situation. There\\'s a lot of speculation but that\\'s not down to me. \"As club captain all I want to do is help us get back up the table and into the Champions League again.\" Gerrard looked set to move to Chelsea during the summer and speculation of a switch to Stamford Bridge has again arisen, with the January transfer window approaching. He raised doubts about his Reds future when he said he wanted the club to prove they were title challengers in the very near future or he might leave. Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has insisted that Gerrard has promised him he wants to stay at Anfield. Benitez said: \"I said to Steven that I was sure he wanted to stay here and he said \\'I do\\'.\\n\\n\"I then said to him \\'Look, if you want to win titles, you want medals and you want Liverpool to have these things then I am going to need your help\\'. \"I really think he wants to stay so now what we must do is make the squad stronger for him.\" Meanwhile, Gerrard has urged the Anfield board to sign Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes in the January transfer window. Morientes, 28, has already expressed a willingness to come to England. Gerrard added: \"He\\'s a great player. He scores goals in the league, in cup competitions and also in the Champions League. \"I don\\'t think he\\'d be able to play for us in Europe this season but if we are able to get hold of him, we\\'d be getting ourselves a great player.\\n\\n\"He\\'d have Spanish coaches, a Spanish manager and we have got three or four Spanish players here now so they\\'ll help him settle in. \"Rafael Benitez knows what he wants and he knows how to strengthen the squad he\\'s got and if the right players become available at the right price I am sure we will strengthen. \"It would certainly be nice to see a few new faces in January to freshen things up.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Broadband set to revolutionise TV\\n\\nBT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband.\\n\\nAs a telecoms company, BT is moving to a content distribution strategy, Andrew Burke, chief of BT\\'s new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum. \"We want to be an entertainment facilitator,\" he said on the opening day of the London conference. The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. The corporation\\'s Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).\\n\\n\"We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers,\" said BT\\'s Andrew Burke.\\n\\nWith more people on broadband, and connection speeds increasing, telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. Increased competition between net service providers, encouraged by Ofcom, has eroded BT\\'s position in the market. It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality. It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (HD) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts. The BBC\\'s iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. Before it officially launches, the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money. Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.\\n\\nIPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services, like Skype. Both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means. Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts.\\n\\nIt is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV. Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity. The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said Rahul Chakkara, controller of BBCi\\'s 24/7 interactive TV services. The iMP is based on peer-to-peer technology, and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast. \"IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times,\" said Mr Chakkara.\\n\\n\"So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee], they can access it any time they want.\" It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like \"digital\", \"interactive\", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes. According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV. They could get IPTV though. Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade. What needs to happen now, agree analysts, is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20Mbps connections would be ideal. BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services, rather as an \"enabler\", said Mr Burke. Its strategy is a \"hybrid\" approach, he explained, where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.\\n\\nInitially appealing to niche markets, like sports fans, it will widen out. But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, \"pet cams\", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT. It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer, 40% of the country.\\n\\nBroadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes. Home Choice already offers 10,000 hours of shows and channels, delivered over broadband to homes in London. With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service. Through content deals and partnerships, it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels, and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. It aims to expand nationally, but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now, and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. Although still at a very early stage, IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.\\n',\n",

The show is seen as Fox\\'s answer to The Apprentice featuring tycoon Donald Trump, a ratings hit for rivals NBC. Sir Richard\\'s show sees a group of young entrepreneurs compete to become the president of his business empire. The Rebel Billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is 91st in the rankings of all prime-time shows.

Nokia, the Finnish handset maker, is planning a party in Singapore this spring to launch its TV to mobile activities in the region. Consultancy Strategy Analytics of Boston estimates that mobile broadcast networks will have acquired around 51 million users worldwide by 2009, producing around $6.6bn (Â£3.5bn) in revenue.\\n\\nSK Telecom of South Korea, which is launching a TV to mobile service (via satellite) in May plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio. It will be able to offer an additional two pay TV channels using conditional access technology. Mr Shin-Bae Kim, chief executive of SK Telecom, also at 3GSM, said: \"We have plans to integrate TV with mobile internet services.\\n\\n\"This will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on TV.\" There will be 12 handsets available for the launch of the Korean service. LG Electronics of South Korea was demonstrating one at 3GSM that could display video at 30 frames a second. Footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. A speech on mobile TV by Angel Gambino of the BBC also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile TV yet are starting to look into it.\\n\\nBut all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile TV arena. There is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: DVB-H for Digital Video Broadcasting for Handsets and DMB for Digital Multimedia Broadcasting. Dr Chan Yeob Yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile TV at LG Electronics, said: \"DMB offers twice the number of frames a minute as DVB-H and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly.\" The Japanese, Koreans and Ericsson of Sweden are backing DMB.\\n\\nSamsung of South Korea has a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May. Nokia, by contrast, is backing DVB-H, and is involved in mobile TV trials that use its art-deco style media phone, which has a larger than usual screen for TV or visual radio (a way of accompanying a radio programme with related text and pictures). Mobile operators O2 and Vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile TV. But even if the standards battle is resolved, there is the thorny issue of broadcasting rights. Ms Gambino says the BBC now negotiates mobile rights when it is negotiating content.\\n\\nFor those not convinced mobile users will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio. Developments in this area are continuing. At a DAB conference in Cannes, several makers of DAB chips for mobiles announced smaller, lower- cost chips which consume less power. Among the chip companies present were Frontier Silicon and Radioscape. The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone. But with many new services going live soon, it won\\'t be long before the industry finds out.\\n',\n",
       " 'ITunes user sues Apple over iPod\\n\\nA user of Apple\\'s iTunes music service is suing the firm saying it is unfair he can only use an iPod to play songs.\\n\\nHe says Apple is breaking anti-competition laws in refusing to let other music players work with the site. Apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the iPod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the iPod. Californian Thomas Slattery filed the suit in the US District Court in San Jose and is seeking damages.\\n\\n\"Apple has turned an open and interactive standard into an artifice that prevents consumers from using the portable hard drive digital music player of their choice,\" the lawsuit states. The key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like iTunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to Ernest Gellhorn, an anti-trust law professor at George Mason University. \"As a practical matter, the lower courts have been highly sceptical of such claims,\" Prof Gellhorn said. Apple has sold more than six million iPods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm NPD Group has reported.\\n\\nMore than 200 million songs have been sold by the iTunes music store since it was launched. \"Apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and/or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice-versa,\" the lawsuit said. Mr Slattery called himself an iTunes customer who \"was also forced to purchase an Apple iPod\" if he wanted to take his music with him to listen to. A spokesman for Apple declined to comment. Apple\\'s online music store uses a different format for songs than Napster, Musicmatch, RealPlayer and others. The rivals use the MP3 format or Microsoft\\'s WMA format while Apple uses AAC, which it says helps thwart piracy. The WMA format also includes so-called Digital Rights Management which is used to block piracy.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hague \\'given up\\' his PM ambition\\n\\nFormer Conservative leader William Hague says he will not stand for the leadership again, having given up his ambition to be prime minister.\\n\\nMr Hague, 43, told the Daily Telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too \"boring\" and unfulfilling. Mr Hague, who stepped down after his party\\'s 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench. He also told the paper he hopes to remain MP for Richmond, North Yorks, and start a family with wife Ffion. Mr Hague, who recently had published the biography of William Pitt the Younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech-writing.\\n\\nHe told the newspaper: \"I don\\'t know whether I will ever go back on to the front, but don\\'t rush me.\" Asked if he would stand for the leadership again, Mr Hague replied: \"No. Definitely not.\" His determination to stay away from a central role will disappoint some senior Conservative members, who say the party needs him. Tim Collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a \"huge boost\" to the party if Mr Hague returned to the front bench. Mr Hague became an MP at 27 and Leader of the Opposition at 36. He said: \"I feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, I had crammed in an entire political career. \"I had been in the Cabinet and been leader of the party, so now I can branch out into other things...it is a very liberating feeling.\" Mr Hague added that he may have misjudged his own ambition to be prime minister. \"Maybe I wasn\\'t as driven by politics as I thought I was,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bad e-mail habits sustains spam\\n\\nThe \\'bad behaviour\\' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found.\\n\\nAccording to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.\\n\\nThe fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. \"This preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,\" said Marcel Nienhuis, market analyst at the Radicati Group. \"It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,\" he said, accusing users of \"bad e-mail behaviour\". Spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm Clearswift. It has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney Sony PSP giveaways. And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. But rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their PC. Clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. \"Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that \\'one thing leads to another\\' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,\" said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift\\'s director of research.\\n\\nSexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm Sophos\\' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. \"The list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex,\" said Mr Cluley. But anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. \"People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn\\'t buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,\" he said.\\n',\n",

       " 'Tory leader unveils spending plan\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard says his party can save Â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste.\\n\\nThe money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the NHS and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. The Tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his MPs, Robert Jackson, a former minister, to Labour. Mr Howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. \"Let\\'s be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what Mr Jackson did\", he told BBC 1\\'s Breakfast with Frost programme. However the defection on Saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the Conservatives\\' spending plans. Fuller details are due to be unveiled on Monday.\\n\\nThe bulk of the Â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, Mr Howard said. The Â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. However, the remainder would deal with some of the \"unfair taxes\". \"Almost every independent expert says if you get another Labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,\" Mr Howard insisted. \"Because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. \"So part of the Â£12bn we are going to apply to filling the government\\'s black hole, reducing the borrowing. \"The rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.\"\\n\\nMr Howard is expected to say that around Â£6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on Monday. The cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter David James. Home Office spending could be cut by Â£1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. Savings of Â£153m at the Foreign Office and Â£336m at the Department for Culture Media and Sport, have also been identified. In all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under Mr James\\' proposals.\\n\\nMr Howard said: \"All this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a Conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.\" However, Chief Treasury Secretary Paul Boateng said: \"None of the Tories\\' figures add up so they can\\'t make these savings and can\\'t pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the Tories is Â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy added: \"People will not be taken in by Michael Howard\\'s claims of Â£35bn worth of savings. \"This can\\'t be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities.\" A poll for the News of the World newspaper suggests the Conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. Labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the Populus survey suggests. And the Liberal Democrats will take three key seats from the Conservatives, leaving the Tories with just 163 MPs, two less than they returned atLabour\\'s 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.\\n',\n",
       " 'Pompeii gets digital make-over\\n\\nThe old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.\\n\\nA European Union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. It would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as Pompeii. It could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism.\\n\\nThe technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.\\n\\nThe Lifeplus project is part of the EU\\'s Information Society Technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing European cultural heritage. Engineers and researchers working in the Europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. It would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. The camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor\\'s viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. At Pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life. Augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as Troy and Lord of the Rings and in computer gaming.\\n\\n\"This technology can now be used for much more than just computer games,\" said Professor Nadia Magnenat-Thalman of the Swiss research group MiraLab.\\n\\n\"We are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time,\" she said. Unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the Lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. Crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor\\'s view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. The software capable of doing this has been developed by a UK company, 2d3. Andrew Stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the EU project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life. \"The popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life,\" he said.\\n',\n",

The news came after UKIP suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed. John Houston, 54, was due to stand in the East Kilbride seat in Lanarkshire at the next election. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. UKIP asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Mr Hockney meanwhile told the BBC: \"I believe that Robert Kilroy-Silk can deliver better as a leader of a eurosceptic party than the current leadership of the UK Independence Party.\"\\n\\nOn the suspension of Mr Houston, UKIP said those who selected him knew nothing of his views. Mr Houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be \"made available to law-abiding members of the community\" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade.\\n\\nThe document reportedly said: \"We\\'re looking for the resurrection of the British Empire. \"The problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the English-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do.\" UKIP spokesman Mark Croucher said the main issue would be that Mr Houston\\'s reported views had been presented as UKIP policy, which they were not.\\n',\n",

During the match at Millwall's new Den Stadium, seats were ripped up and four people were ejected from the ground. A disabled fan was injured at the perimeter of the pitch and riot police were needed to control the situation. Liverpool fans claimed the trouble was sparked by chants about the Hillsborough disaster, where 96 supporters were crushed to death in April 1989. But Lions chairman Theo Paphitis has denied the claims. He has said CCTV footage showed the catalyst for the trouble was a Liverpool fan attacking a Millwall fan in the west stand. However, Millwall have been charged with two breaches of FA rules. They have been charged with failing to ensure that fans refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour and for failing to prevent spectators throwing missiles onto the pitch.

The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour\\'s campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.\\n\\nWriting in the Guardian newspaper, Mr Brown outlined his view of the direction New Labour should be taking. \"As our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, Labour\\'s ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities.\" BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown\\'s article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. \"It was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,\" was Mr Marr\\'s assessment. The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown\\'s article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor\\'s role would be \"central\". Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown\\'s management of the economy. And he pledged childcare would be a \"centrepiece\" of Labour\\'s manifesto. He also predicted the next general election will be a \"tough, tough fight\" for New Labour. But the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 May.

Qwest chairman Richard Notebaert sent a letter to MCI\\'s board on Thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining Verizon\\'s bid. Formerly known as Worldcom, MCI is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. Snapping up MCI would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. Shares of MCI were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of New York markets.\\n\\nQwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"We would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the Verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire MCI,\" the letter from Qwest said. Verizon\\'s offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues MCI. Verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each MCI share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. Both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. As well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, Qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than Verizon\\'s.\\n\\nThe takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&T for about $16bn. There may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as MCI only emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. Verizon is far bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Also, MCI, while trading under the name Worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in US history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep Wall Street happy.\\n',\n",

The chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.\\n\\nThe three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. In a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in February next year at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe three firms claim that the Cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. When put inside powerful computer servers, the Cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. The chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. IBM said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the US. The first machines off the line using the Cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. A working version of the PS3 is due to be shown off in May 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006.

       " 'WMC profits up amid bid criticism\\n\\nAustralian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.\\n\\nWMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; Â£550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before. It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.\\n\\nTrade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be \"against the national interest\". Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata\\'s attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia\\'s Woodside Petroleum in 2001. The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC\\'s interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. Copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to China\\'s booming economy, which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years. Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Local net TV takes off in Austria\\n\\nAn Austrian village is testing technology that could represent the future of television.\\n\\nThe people of Engerwitzdorf are filming, editing and producing their own regional news channel. The channel covers local politics, sports, events and anything that residents want to film and are prepared to upload for others to watch on PCs. The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.\\n\\n\"It\\'s growing unbelievably fast,\" said Rudolf Fischer, head of Telekom Austria\\'s fixed line division. The trial of Buntes Fernsehen (Multi-Coloured TV) was started in late 2004 and creates a net-based TV station run by the 8,000 residents of Engerwitzdorf. The hardware and software to turn video footage into edited programmes has been provided by Telekom Austria but this equipment, following training, has been turned over to the villagers. Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch. Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes. In the first four months of the project villagers have created 60 films and put together regular reports on local news items. \"They have adopted it very quickly,\" said Mr Fischer. \"They like the possibility to create their own content and see what\\'s going on in the area.\" \"It\\'s kind of the democratisation of local TV,\" he said, \"because none of the bigger broadcasters would ever do anything like this for that region.\" The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas. Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes. The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria\\'s online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC. Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it. In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.\\n',\n",

The world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward. And former England captain Moore told the BBC: \"Full-backs are too far away from the action. That\\'s not a reflection on Robinson personally.\" He added: \"I just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is, after all, where games usually start and finish.\" Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and Ireland in this year\\'s tournament. \"Assertiveness in the pack isn\\'t there, we\\'re not getting enough people into the breakdowns,\" he explained. \"Wer\\'e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. Their creativity depends on quick ball and we\\'re not getting that.\"\\n\\nWith injuries depriving him of key players like Wilkinson, coach Andy Robinson has given youngsters such as Harry Ellis and Jamie Noon a chance. And Moore believes the last two games against Italy and Scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. \"The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don\\'t have the requisite experience,\" Moore added. \"You can\\'t do anything about that but play them. There are players who have been knocking on the door, it\\'s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there\\'s nothing on them. \"We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.\"\\n',\n",

The Usdaw trade union said shop workers should be able to enjoy a break with their families. MSP Karen Whitefield wants to ensure only those whose roles are essential are at work over the festive season. In recent years, more stores have been opening on traditional holidays, with some starting their end-of-year sale on Christmas Day or New Year\\'s Day. Ms Whitefield said: \"I have found members of the public to be very supportive when I have been campaigning on the streets.\\n\\n\"The early evidence shows quite clearly that the vast majority of people believe that shop workers should be given these two special days to spend with friends and family.\" Usdaw general secretary John Hannett added: \"Christmas Day and New Year\\'s Day are special days for everyone in Scotland and the fact that shops do not open is an important part of making them special. They are largely collective days of rest. \"We want people to tell Karen, through her consultation, whether they want the special nature of these days to remain, or whether they want them to become like any other trading day, with shops open for business as usual.\" The consultation on a Christmas & New Year\\'s Day Trading Bill has so far attracted almost 500 responses and closes on 7 February.\\n',\n",
       " \"Europe backs digital TV lifestyle\\n\\nHow people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious European project.\\n\\nIn Nice last week, the European Commission announced its Networked & Electronic Media (NEM) initiative. Its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. The Commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. More than 120 experts were in Nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as Nokia, Intel, Philips, Alcatel, France Telecom, Thomson and Telefonica. It might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. But again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. A long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.\\n\\nThe European Commission is being pragmatic in its approach. They have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that NEM encompasses. The NEM approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. Where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. What is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. This is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. Many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the Commission will be to identify a solution for different Digital Rights Management (DRM) schemes. Currently DRM solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. With the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant DRM scheme is huge. Although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. The 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the EC has been funding for a number of years.\\n\\nSimon Perry is the editor of the Digital Lifestyles website, which covers the impact of technology on media\\n\",\n",

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that\\'s the extra Â£1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner\\'s maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government\\'s statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government\\'s plans will be outlined on Monday.

Trendy youth labels also sold well, with sales jumping 28% at young women\\'s clothing retailer Bebe Stores and 32.2% at American Eagle Outfitters. But Wal-Mart only saw its sales rise after it cut prices. The company saw a 3% rise in December sales, less than the 4.3% rise seen a year earlier.\\n\\nCustomers at the world\\'s biggest retailer are generally seen to be the most vulnerable to America\\'s economic woes.\\n\\nCommentators claim many have cut back on spending amid uncertainty over job security, while low and middle-income Americans have reined in spending in the face of higher gasoline prices. Analysts said Wal-Mart faced a \"stand-off\" with shoppers, stepping up its discounts as the festive season wore on, as consumers waited longer to get the best bargains. However, experts added that if prices had not been cut across the sector, Christmas sales - which account for nearly 23% of annual retail sales - would have been far worse. \"So far, we are faring better than expected, but the results are still split,\" Ken Perkins, an analyst at research firm RetailMetrics LLC, told Associated Press. \"Stores that have been struggling over the last couple of months appear to be continuing that trend.

However, the losers were many and varied. Home furnishings store Pier 1 Imports saw its same store sales sink by a larger-than-forecast 8.8% as it battled fierce competition. Leading electronics chain Best Buy, meanwhile, missed its sales target of a 3-5% rise in sales, turning in a 2.5% increase over the Christmas period. Accessory vendor Claire\\'s Stores also suffered as an expected last minute shopping rush never materialised, leaving its same store sales 5% higher, compared to a 6% rise last year. Jeweller Zale also felt little Christmas cheer with December sales down 0.7% on the same month last year. \"This was not a good period for retailers or shoppers. We saw a dearth of exciting, new items,\" Kurt Barnard, president of industry forecaster Retail Consulting Group, said.

The other proposed names include a domain for pornography, Asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the Catalan language and culture.\\n\\nThe .post domain is backed by the Universal Postal Union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.\\n\\nThe .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. It is backed by a New York-based trade group called The Travel Partnership. Icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. Despite this initial approval, Icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. At the same time Icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. One that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. A similar proposal has been made many times in the past. But Icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. In 2000 Icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. Three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. Others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. In total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. But domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.\\n\",\n",

They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.\\n\\nFormer Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian\\'s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football.

The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee\\'s offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.\\n\\nThey withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set.

With the recovery slowing, the world\\'s second biggest economy is now expected grow by 0.2% in 2004. The Tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. Big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the March reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. The dollar\\'s decline has strengthened the yen, making Japanese exports more expensive in the US. China\\'s attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit Japanese industry\\'s sales abroad. Confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the March survey. Nonetheless, Japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening.

The series Who\\'s Your Daddy, where a young woman tries to pick her natural father for a cash prize caused outrage from adoption groups and rated badly. Last season, Fox\\'s prime-time audience fell by 600,000 to 5.9 million. Ms Berman said: \"I think the audience expects loud things from Fox. Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don\\'t.\"\\n\\nWho\\'s Your Daddy, the first episode of which was shown on 3 January, pulled in a disappointing audience of 6.3 million, according to the Nielsen ratings system. Five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from Fox\\'s schedules, Ms Berman said. She was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network\\'s established reality shows, such as American Idol, which is due to start its fourth series this week. Fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every season, including the traditionally quiet summer season. Though that had met with a poor reception, Ms Berman said \"there\\'s no question that the audience, in our mind, is ready, willing and able to accept new programming in the summer\".

He realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind. \"I\\'m sure if he were alive today he would believe Africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the Aids epidemic.\"\\n\\n: \"The final tune of his final album was Redemption Song - one of the most incredible classics of all time.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Ethnic producers \\'face barriers\\'\\n\\nMinority ethnic led (Mel) production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries, research has suggested.\\n\\nThe study, commissioned by Pact and the UK Film Council, included interviews with industry experts and individuals. They indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies. The research indicated that about 10% of independent production companies in the UK are minority ethnic led.\\n\\nA minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decision-making power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group. The report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and TV industries. It said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources, so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms. The research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice, plus improved communication within the film and TV sectors. \"The UK has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television,\" said Arts minister Estelle Morris of the findings. \"I welcome this report which I hope will lead to more doors being opened and all businesses in our film and television industries being given the same opportunities.\"\\n',\n",

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\\n\\nIt also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. The payment is not related to the FCC\\'s $550,000 (Â£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson\\'s breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January. Viacom is contesting that fine. It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges. Infinity Broadcasting, which is owned by Viacom, paid cumulative fines totalling $1.7m (Â£907,000) in 1995 to settle FCC violations by Stern.\\n',\n",

The government gives Â£200 for winter fuel to households with people over 60, or Â£300 where people are over 80. The Tories promise to keep the payments. The Lib Dems would allow people to swap these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey said: \"The current scheme has helped some older people, but this new Liberal Democrat approach will go much further to end the scandal of tens of thousands of old people dying from the winter cold every year.\" The vouchers are designed to let pensioners choose from a list of approved energy supplies who would compete for business by offering discounts on home insulation schemes. The plan would boost energy conservation, says the party - and insulation could save Â£100 every year for pensioner households, so using the money more \"intelligently\" than at present.\\n',\n",

The two competing DVD formats, Blu-ray developed by Sony and others, and Toshiba's HD-DVD, have been courting top film studios for several months. The next generation of DVDs promise very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. Both technologies use a blue laser to write information. It has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. Disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s Betamax versus VHS war. Sony lost out to JVC in that fight.\\n\\nThe current battle for Hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. Last month, Paramount, Universal and Warner Brothers said they were opting for the Toshiba and NEC-backed format, HD-DVD high-definition discs.\\n\\nThose studios currently produce about 45% of DVD content. Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM Studios have already staked their allegiance with the Blu-ray Disc Association, whose members also include technology companies Dell, Samsung and Matsushita. Twentieth Century Fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. If Fox decided to go with Blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of DVD content. Disney said its films would be available on the Blu-ray format when DVD players for the standard went on sale on North America and Japan, expected in 2006. Universal is to start producing films on the HD-DVD format in 2005, and Paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. Toshiba expects sales of HD-DVDs to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, Â£1.5bn) by 2010.\\n\",\n",

But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.\\n\\nLast November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet\\'s right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films \"of French expression\", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin\\'s Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche\\'s L\\'Esquive and France\\'s number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.\\n\\nBest actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L\\'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. Tautou will compete against Maggie Cheung , Emmanuelle Devos, Yolande Moreau and Karin Viard for best actress. Michael Moore\\'s Fahrenheit 9/11, The Motorcycle Diaries, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 21 Grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. The awards ceremony will be held on 26 February. This year, Will Smith, star of I, Robot, Independence Day and Men In Black, will be given an honorary Cesar, along with French singer/actor, Jacques Dutronc.\\n',\n",

The TUC said cuts would deliver less than 6% of the Â£22bn ministers hope to save through efficiency reforms. General secretary Brendan Barber warned the \"costs could easily outweigh the benefits\". \"The government\\'s big boost to public spending is now showing results,\" said Mr Barber. \"Public services are improving but looking for simple savings through job cuts at this stage could be a false economy.\\n\\n\"They may shoot a Tory fox, but cutting thousands of civil service jobs will hit the morale and capabilities of the public servants expected to implement government reforms. The costs could easily outweigh the benefits.\" Next Friday\\'s strike action by the PCS is the biggest in the civil service since 1993, hitting Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices, customs and driving tests. The union says it is concerned about pensions, sick pay and forced relocation as well as the cut in jobs. Last month it was announced that a total of 37 social security offices and Jobcentres across the UK would close in the first wave of plans to shed civil service jobs. The number of civil servants in Britain rose to more than 520,000 in April. Other areas the strike will affect include passports, museums and galleries, libraries and health and safety inspections.\\n',\n",
       " 'Winn-Dixie files for bankruptcy\\n\\nUS supermarket group Winn-Dixie has filed for bankruptcy protection after succumbing to stiff competition in a market dominated by Wal-Mart.\\n\\nWinn-Dixie, once among the most profitable of US grocers, said Chapter 11 protection would enable it to successfully restructure. It said its 920 stores would remain open, but analysts said it would most likely off-load a number of sites. The Jacksonville, Florida-based firm has total debts of $1.87bn (Â£980m). In its bankruptcy petition it listed its biggest creditor as US foods giant Kraft Foods, which it owes $15.1m.\\n\\nAnalysts say Winn-Dixie had not kept up with consumers\\' demands and had also been burdened by a number of stores in need of upgrading. A 10-month restructuring plan was deemed a failure, and following a larger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier this month, Winn-Dixie\\'s slide into bankruptcy was widely expected. The company\\'s new chief executive Peter Lynch said Winn-Dixie would use the Chapter 11 breathing space to take the necessary action to turn itself around. \"This includes achieving significant cost reductions, improving the merchandising and customer service in all locations and generating a sense of excitement in the stores,\" he said. Yet Evan Mann, a senior bond analyst at Gimme Credit, said Mr Lynch\\'s job would not be easy, as the bankruptcy would inevitably put off some customers. \"The real big issue is what\\'s going to happen over the next one or two quarters now that they are in bankruptcy and all their customers see this in their local newspapers,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Booming markets shed few tears\\n\\nThe market, former British government minister Michael Heseltine once said, has no morality.\\n\\nAnd indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week\\'s disaster. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. And this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.\\n\\nIn fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.\\n\\nFor a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. The overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from India, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.\\n\\nSecond, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. Most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. Tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. But there are winners as well as losers. Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week.\\n\\nMore broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.\\n\\nAccording to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. \"Although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,\" the authors concluded.\\n\\nBut disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.\\n\\nIn particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. In fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. A series of recent shocks, the Colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan\\'s banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo. And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. \"It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,\" one Bombay trader said this week. \"But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Arsenal through on penalties\\n\\nArsenal win 4-2 on penalties\\n\\nThe Spanish goalkeeper saved from Alan Quinn and Jon Harley as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. Lauren, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Ashley Cole scored for Arsenal, while Andy Gray and Phil Jagielka were on target for the Blades. Michael Tonge and Harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but Paddy Kenny was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker Arturo Lupoli with Ljungberg up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as Tonge wasted a glorious chance. Gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left Tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.\\n\\nArsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although Ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by Cesc Fabregas. Arsene Wenger introduced Quincy Owusu-Abeyie for the ineffective Lupoli at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by Mathieu Flamini, but his finish was tame and Kenny saved easily. Owusu-Abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by Fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by Kenny's legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when Fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by Jagielka to deny Ljungberg as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again Kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from Fabregas. Neil Warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when Derek Geary's cross found Harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by Almunia. Owusu-Abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for Ljungberg. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on Jeremie Aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. Kolo Toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but Kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. Almunia was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.\\n\\nKenny, Geary, Morgan, Bromby, Harley, Liddell, Montgomery, Jagielka, Thirlwell, Tonge (Quinn 97), Gray.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Francis, Kabba, Shaw, Haystead.\\n\\nMorgan.\\n\\nAlmunia, Lauren, Cygan, Senderos, Cole, Fabregas (Toure 90), Vieira, Flamini (Aliadiere 113), Clichy, Lupoli (Owusu-Abeyie 45), Ljungberg.\\n\\nSubs Not Used: Eboue, Taylor.\\n\\nClichy, Lauren, Senderos.\\n\\n27,595\\n\\nP Dowd (Staffordshire).\\n\",\n",

Some 270 hunts met legally on Saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. But anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. Countryside Alliance chairman John Jackson said that Saturday had been a \"massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting\". People had turned out \"to show en masse that the Hunting Act was a bad law\", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed \"legally\" as far as he was aware.\\n\\nAlthough hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. Addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, Mr Michael told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today Programme: \"There has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. \"The reality is that the law is very clear. You can\\'t chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. \"If people do so and pretend they\\'re not it\\'s going to become very clear. You can\\'t hunt accidentally.\" Mr Michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. He said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children\\'s future than hunting.\\n\\nBut the League Against Cruel Sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. Thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across England and Wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. There were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in Wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the Hunting Act.\\n\\nThey have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. But Penny Little, who monitored the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, said she had witnessed \"gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes\". If people tried to \"run circles around this law\" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. Mike Hobday, from the League Against Cruel Sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. He said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. But Mr Jackson, who had been at the Bicester Hunt in Oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.\\n',\n",

Notts police chief Steve Green said innocent people would suffer. But Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell said a delay would be \"disastrous\" and she accused the Tories of opportunism. The government would go ahead with the changes which would give police more power to tackle excessive drinking, she added. Earlier chief constable Green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises. \"If you look at the Market Square in Nottingham, if a fight takes place which licensed premises do you go and lay the responsibilty at the door of?\" he asked on BBC Radio 4\\'s World at One programme.\\n\\nHe warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night. Earlier this year the Royal College of Physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an \"epidemic\" of binge drinking. Minister Richard Caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises. It is hoped that allowing pubs and clubs to stay open longer will stagger closing times and end the current situation where drinkers spill on to the streets all at once. Earlier Tony Blair defended the plans against criticism from one of his own backbenchers.\\n\\n\"My view of this is very clear: we should have the same flexibility that other countries have and then we should come down really hard on those who abuse that freedom and don\\'t show the responsibility,\" he told MPs. \"The law-abiding majority who want the ability, after going to the cinema or theatre say, to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced, we shouldn\\'t have to have restrictions that no other city in Europe has, just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol, who go out and fight and cause disturbances. \"To take away that ability for all the population - even the vast majority who are law abiding - is not, in my view, sensible.\" This week a judge claimed easy access to drink was breeding \"urban savages\" and turning town centres into no go areas.

Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against \"rent, rip and return\" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.\\n',\n",
       " 'Howard unveils Tory asylum plans\\n\\nTory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said.\\n\\nAs his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs. There would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. Some charities say the plans would put refugees\\' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled.\\n\\nTony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. \"By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,\" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was \"absolutely disgusting\" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set.\\n\\nIn a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It\\'s not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\" He said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that \"firm but fair\" immigration controls were essential for good community relations.\\n\\n\\n - Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers \\n - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents \\n - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for \"national security\" \\n - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps. Anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin. \\n \\n\\nThe Tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an Australian-style points system and those wanting to join families in the UK.\\n\\nMr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough. The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure. He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current \"unfair and inhumane\" system.\\n\\n\"We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum,\" Mr Howard said. \"By breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling.\"\\n\\nBut the UN refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees. And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case. Refugee Council Chief Executive Maeve Sherlock called the plans \"dangerous, ill thought-out and hugely irresponsible\". Lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled, she warned. Commission for Racial Equality chairman Trevor Phillips said asylum applications were down 40% and economic migration down about 10%.\\n\\nHe did not think Mr Howard intended to centre the debate about race. But he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture. Mr Howard called that suggestion \"disgraceful\".\\n',\n",

But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we\\'ll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club\\'s top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy\\'s absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday.\\n',\n",

Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich\\'s Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet\\'s Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi\\'s La Traviata and Richard Strauss\\'s Ariadne auf Naxos.\\n\\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet\\'s Le Roi de Lahore.

He plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid. Unions oppose the plans but Mr Brown said Â£2bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage. A further 200 jobs at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been earmarked to be cut. At the Department for Work and Pensions, 30,000 jobs are to go, 560 will be lost by the end of the month at the Department of Trade and Industry and 400 are to go at the Inland Revenue and Customs.\\n\\nIn his Budget statement, the chancellor said the first 12,500 civil service jobs had been cut, on target.

Of those 300 Department of Health posts will go to Yorkshire while hundreds at the Department of Culture will move to Birmingham and Newcastle.\\n\\nMr Brown also announced plans to merge 35 agencies into nine - described by one civil service union as a \"bonfire of the quangos\".

China\\'s Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. The threat of higher raw material costs also hit industries such as carmakers. France\\'s Peugeot warned that its profits may decline this year as a result of the higher steel, plastic and commodity prices.\\n\\nSteelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen, driven by the booming economies of countries such as China and India. Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China.\\n\\nThe boom times are far from over, but analysts say that earnings growth may slow. The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world\\'s biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices. Miners Rio Tinto and Cia. Vale Do Rio Dolce (CVRD) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore, a key component of steel. Analysts had expected Japan\\'s Nippon to agree to a price rise of between 40% and 50%. Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD\\'s price rise was \"uncharted territory\", adding that the steel industry \"hasn\\'t seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years\". Analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as Australia\\'s BHP Billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%.\\n\\nThe news triggered the share price weakness. \"It sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs]\" explained Kazuhiro Takahashi of Daiwa Securities SMBC. In Europe, Arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in Paris, with ThyssenKrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros. In London, Corus fell 2.2% to 55.57 pence. Japan\\'s biggest steel company Nippon Steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen, with closest rival JFE Holdings down 3.4%. China\\'s Baoshan, the country\\'s largest steel producer, said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale. The firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors. No date has been given for when the 5 billion shares will come to the market. Baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.\\n',\n",

       " 'Mobiles rack up 20 years of use\\n\\nMobile phones in the UK are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.\\n\\nBritain\\'s first mobile phone call was made across the Vodafone network on 1 January 1985 by veteran comedian Ernie Wise. In the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of Britons own a handset. Mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.\\n\\nThe first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in New York but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. The first call was made from St Katherine\\'s dock to Vodafone\\'s head office in Newbury which at the time was over a curry house. For the first nine days of 1985 Vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the UK. Then on 10 January Cellnet (now O2) launched its service. Mike Caudwell, spokesman for Vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about Â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.\\n\\n\"Despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,\" he said. \"They became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk.\" This was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. He said it took Vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. \"It\\'s very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,\" he said. \"Cellnet was forecasting half that.\" Now Vodafone has 14m customers in the UK alone. Cellnet and Vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the UK until 1993 when One2One (now T-Mobile) was launched. Orange had its UK launch in 1994. Both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. The analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. Called Global System for Mobiles (GSM) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. Mr Caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.\\n',\n",

Part of the investigation has centred on whether they staged the crash. Kenteris insisted: \"The accident happened. I went crazy when I found out I had supposedly missed a test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic village.\" Kenteris, speaking on Greece\\'s Alter Television station, also claimed that he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. \"I told the hospital, which was an Olympics-accredited hospital, to call the IOC and have me tested on the spot but no-one came.\"\\n\\nAfter a drama which dominated newspaper headlines in Greece as Athens prepared for the start of the Athens Games, Kenteris and Thanou eventually withdrew.

Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (Â£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.\\n',\n",

In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. \"I\\'m not prejudiced, I\\'ll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!\" he joked.\\n\\nAnother exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world\\'s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire.\\n\\n\"We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,\" said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. \"The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we\\'ve yet to turn anybody away.\" Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a \\'duck clutch\\' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.\\n\\nWhen Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion.\\n\\nAnd it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter\\'s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs.

       " 'Tories plan migrant health checks\\n\\nNon-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.\\n\\nA positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against \"pandering to prejudice\".\\n\\nThe proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. \"It\\'s very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. \"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,\" said Mr Howard.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.\" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants\\' claims. The proposals include:\\n\\n- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a \"high incidence TB country\" will have to undergo a chest X-ray. \\n - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to \"demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health\". \\n - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to \"impose significant costs or demands\" on the NHS. \\n - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a \"case by case basis\".\\n\\nThere is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: \"TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well.\" The government says the Tories are \"a bit late\" to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: \"We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. \"Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.\" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. \"Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.\" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. \"In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,\" she said.\\n',\n",
       " 'IAAF awaits Greek pair\\'s response\\n\\nKostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou are yet to respond to doping charges from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\\n\\nThe Greek pair were charged after missing a series of routine drugs tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens. They have until midnight on 16 December and an IAAF spokesman said: \"We\\'re sure their responses are on their way.\" If they do not respond or their explanations are rejected, they will be provisionally banned from competition. They will then face a hearing in front of the Greek Federation, which will ultimately determine their fate. Their former coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing banned substances. Under IAAF rules, the athletes could receive a maximum one-year suspension. Kenteris and Thanou already face a criminal trial after being charged with avoiding a drug test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and then faking a motorcyle crash.\\n\\nNo date for the trial has yet been set and again Tzekos is also facing charges. The IAAF issued an official warning to the trio last year after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. All athletes must inform their national federations where they are at all times, so they can be available for out-of-competition drugs tests. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Then just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens and withdrew from the Games.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK economy ends year with spurt\\n\\nThe UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\\n\\nThe figure is in line with Treasury and Bank of England forecasts. The ONS says gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 December, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. The rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst Christmas for retailers in decades.\\n\\nThe annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. Growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. \"On the basis of the latest information the UK has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,\" said Paul Boateng, chief secretary to the Treasury in a statement.\\n\\nThe ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. The strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in December and across the Christmas holiday period. \"The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,\" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.\\n\\nHowever, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers\\' organisation EEF, said: \"These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. \"Whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, \\'recession\\' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise.\" The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.\\n\\nSimon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: \"This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy.\" And he said the GDP figures may help to \"push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve\". \"The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. This is consistent with our own thinking,\" said Mr Rubinsohn. The Bank of England\\'s nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%, minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Landmark movies\\' of 2004 hailed\\n\\nUS film professionals have declared Fahrenheit 9/11 and The Passion of the Christ as two of the most significant cultural milestones of 2004.\\n\\nThe American Film Institute (AFI) hailed Mel Gibson\\'s biblical epic and Michael Moore\\'s political documentary as inspiring national debate. It claimed both film-makers \"tossed Hollywood convention out the window\". The Institute also cited the death of actor Marlon Brando and the changing landscape of TV news in the US. In referring to Marlon Brando\\'s death on 1 July at the age of 80, the 13-strong AFI jury concluded \"the art of screen acting has two chapters - \\'Before Brando\\' and \\'After Brando\\'.\\n\\nIt credited the screen legend\\'s \"raw hypnotic energy\" and his ability to create characters like Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy \"that will live forever in the annals of film history\". The list also acknowledges key influences and trends in the world of film and broadcasting. Among current trends, it highlighted the final broadcasts of veteran newscasters Tom Brokaw, Barbara Walters and the impending retirement of CBS news anchor Dan Rather. It its place, the AFI fears, is a news landscape where \"newscasters are more personalities than journalists\" and balance and integrity are increasingly ignored.\\n\\nThe AFI also questioned \"the long-term viability of evening news broadcasts\", in the light of 24-hour news channels and the internet. The list also draws attention to the growing influence of US broadcasting regulator, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\\n\\nThe institute concluded the threat of regulation, which went into freefall following Janet Jackson\\'s \\'wardrobe malfunction\\' during a live Super Bowl performance in February, \"had a profound effect on television\". \"Unsure of how the FCC will rule on an issue, the creative community has begun to self-censor their shows, a disturbing trend in a country founded on free expression,\" the AFI jury declared. To illustrate their point, the AFI cited ABC affiliates refusal to air Steven Spielberg\\'s film Saving Private Ryan in an unedited form over fears of possible fines.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mac Mini heralds mini revolution\\n\\nThe Mac Mini was launched amid much fanfare by Apple and great excitement by Apple watchers last month. But does the latest Macintosh justify the hype? Let us get a few things dealt with at the outset - yes, the Mac Mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired Apple design. There is more to be said on the computer\\'s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the Mac Mini is a just a computer. Inside that small box there is a G4 processor, a CD/DVD player, a hard drive, some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system. A DVD burner, wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost. And if you do not have a monitor, keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also.\\n\\nIt is not the fastest computer for the money but for under Â£400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications - Apple software. The Mac Mini comes bundled with Mac OS X, the operating system, as well as iLife 05, a suite of software which includes iTunes, web browser Safari, iPhoto, Garage Band and iDVD. I doubt many PC lovers would seriously argue that Windows XP comes with a better suite of programs than Mac OS X.\\n\\nOf course, users of open source operating system Linux draw up their own menu of programs. For people who want to do interesting things with their music, photos and home movies then a Mac Mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer. \"It\\'s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of Window and viruses,\" said Mark Sparrow, technical and reviews editor at Mac Format magazine. He added: \"In essence, it\\'s a laptop in a biscuit tin, minus the screen and the keyboard. \"The software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget PC look a bit sick.\" The relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically-savvy to experiment with their Macs. One user has already created a \"dock\" to enable him to plug in and out his Mac Mini in his car.\\n\\nThe small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in-car entertainment - playing movies and music - as well as navigation. Another user has mounted his Mac Mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse. When it was first announced some pundits thought the Mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre - ie the machine would be used to serve TV programmes, music, films and photos - partly due to its small, living room friendly design. But there are obvious reasons why this is not the case - at least not in the here and now The hard drive - at 80GB for the larger model - is too small to be realistically used as media centre.\\n\\nWhile commercial Personal Video Recorders are on the market with smaller than 80GB hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store TV content. A media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80GB just seems too small. Most PCs running Windows Media Center have at least 120GB hard disks. Coupled with the lack of a TV tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the Mac Mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not. But that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the Mac Mini to media centre uses. So - is the Mac Mini just another computer or a revolution in computing? Graham Barlow, editor of Mac Format, understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint. \"It\\'s just a Mac, but we should be very excited - it\\'s revolutionary in its size (smaller than PCs), looks (looks better than PCs), and the fact that it\\'s the first Mac designed to really go for the low-cost PC market.\" The design of the Mac Mini is further evidence of a future when PCs are more than just bland, bulky boxes. There are a number of companies who already produce miniature PCs based on mini-ITX motherboards. But at the moment these PCs tend to be either for the home-build enthusiast or expensive pre-built options based around Microsoft\\'s Media Center software. But for the value the Mac Mini offers, bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before, Apple is to be congratulated. Let us say then that if the Mac Mini is not a fully fledged revolution - it is a mini revolution.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Blog\\' picked as word of the year\\n\\nThe term \"blog\" has been chosen as the top word of 2004 by a US dictionary publisher.\\n\\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" headed the list of most looked-up terms on its site during the last twelve months. During 2004 blogs, or web logs, have become hugely popular and some have started to influence mainstream media. Other words on the Merriam-Webster list were associated with major news events such as the US presidential election or natural disasters that hit the US.\\n\\nMerriam-Webster defines a blog as: \"a Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments and often hyperlinks\". Its list of most looked-up words is drawn up every year and it discounts terms such as swear words, that everyone likes to look up, or those that always cause problems, such as \"affect\" and \"effect\".\\n\\nMerriam-Webster said \"blog\" was the word that people have asked to be defined or explained most often over the last 12 months. The word will now appear in the 2005 version of Merriam-Webster\\'s printed dictionary. However, the word is already included in some printed versions of the Oxford English Dictionary. A spokesman for the Oxford University Press said that the word was now being put into other dictionaries for children and learners, reflecting its mainstream use. \"I think it was the word of last year rather than this year,\" he said. \"Now we\\'re getting words that derive from it such as \\'blogosphere\\' and so on,\" he said. \"But,\" he added, \"it\\'s a pretty recent thing and in the way that this happens these days it\\'s got established very quickly.\"\\n\\nBlogs come in many different forms. Many act as news sites for particular groups or subjects, some are written from a particular political slant and others are simply lists of interesting sites. Other terms in the top 10 were related to natural disasters that have struck the US, such as \"hurricane\" or were to do with the US election. Words such as \"incumbent\", \"electoral\" and \"partisan\" reflected the scale of interest in the vote. Blogs also proved very useful to both sides in the US election battle because many pundits who maintain their own journals were able to air opinions that would never appear in more mainstream media. Speculation that President Bush was getting help during debates via a listening device was first aired on web logs. Online journals also raised doubts about documents used by US television news organisation CBS in a story about President Bush\\'s war record. The immediacy of many blogs also helped some wield influence over topics that made it in to national press.\\n\\nThis is despite the fact that the number of people reading even the most influential blogs is tiny. Statistics by web influence ranking firm HitWise reveal that the most popular political blog racks up only 0.0051% of all net visits per day. One of the reasons that blogs and regularly updated online journals have become popular is because the software used to put them together make it very easy for people to air their views online. According to blog analysis firm Technorati the number of blogs in existence, the blogosphere, has doubled every five and a half months for the last 18 months. Technorati now estimates that the number of blogs in existence has exceeded 4.8 million. Some speculate that less than a quarter of this number are regularly maintained. According to US research firm Pew Internet & American Life a blog is created every 5.8 seconds. Another trend this year has been the increasing numbers of weblogs that detail the daily lives of many ordinary workers in jobs that few people know much about. In many repressive regimes and developing nations, blogs have been embraced by millions of people keen to give their plight a voice.\\n',\n",

Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.\\n\\nInvestors were shaken by the news and the firm\\'s shares fell to a four month low of A$4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at A$4.67. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. Increased costs at Wembley and a separate development in London\\'s Docklands saw Multiplex\\'s construction division report profits of A$35.1m.\\n\\nThe firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its UK projects - which also include the White City redevelopment scheme in west London - were performing strongly.\\n\\nTo recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. \"Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,\" it said. \"It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.\" Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. Analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. \"Such a big writeback on the Wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility,\" Simon Wheatley, from Goldman Sachs, told Reuters.\\n',\n",

So I said, \\'have a go at me\\',\" he said. \"If he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that Gary Neville is an easy target, I\\'m not having it.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: \"Vieira was well wound up for it. \"I\\'ve heard different stories.

       " 'Anti-spam screensaver scrapped\\n\\nA contentious campaign to bump up the bandwidth bills of spammers by flooding their sites with data has been dropped.\\n\\nLycos Europe\\'s Make Love, Not Spam campaign began in late November but its tactics proved controversial. Lycos has shut down the campaign saying it had been started to stimulate debate about anti-spam measures and had now achieved this aim. The anti-spammer screensaver came under fire for encouraging vigilante activity and skirting the edge of the law.\\n\\nThrough the Make Love, Not Spam website, users could download a screensaver that would endlessly request data from the net sites mentioned in many junk mail messages. More than 100,000 people are thought to have downloaded the screensaver that Lycos Europe offered.\\n\\nThe company wanted to keep the spam sites running at near total capacity to make it much less financially attractive to spammers to operate the sites. But the campaign was controversial from the moment it kicked off and many net veterans criticised it for using spamming-type tactics against the senders of junk mail. Some net service firms began blocking access to the Lycos Europe site in protest at the action. Monitoring firm Netcraft found that the anti-spam campaign was proving a little too successful. According to response-time figures gathered by Netcraft, some of the sites that the screensaver targeted were being knocked offline by the constant data requests. In a statement from Lycos Europe announcing the scrapping of the scheme, the company denied that this was its fault. \"There is nothing to suggest that Make Love, Not Spam has brought down any of the sites that it has targeted,\" it said. \"At the time that Netcraft measured the sites it claims may have been brought down, they were not in fact part of the Make Love, Not Spam attack cycle,\" it added. The statement issued by Lycos also said that the centralised database it used ensured that traffic to the target sites left them with 5% spare capacity. \"The idea was simply to slow spammers\\' sites and this was achieved by the campaign,\" the company said. Many security organisations said users should not participate in the Lycos Europe campaign. The closure comes only days after the campaign was suspended following the outbreak of criticism.\\n',\n",

The report said: \"For rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity.\" It also points out that in 1970 the G8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. But 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.\\n\\nIt argues that the price of not investing in poor countries\\' sustainable development will be felt across the world. The report said: \"Global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. \"Environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders.

Mr Brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to Britain by the world\\'s poor nations.

A new book says the prime minister went back on a pledge to Mr Brown to stand down before the next general election. The chancellor has said he is focused on winning the poll and is due to join election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch this week. Mr Blair told the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Monday: \"I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need.\" The prime minister and his chancellor arrived within seconds of each other and seemingly in good spirits at the start of the meeting which lasted around an hour. A new book, Brown\\'s Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, says Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.\\n\\nIt has caused a new wave of concern among Labour MPs gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in May, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the PLP meeting. Health Secretary John Reid earlier warned that Labour members would not easily forgive anybody fuelling damaging speculation. He told BBC News: \"Those who co-operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short-term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re-election chances of the Labour Party and the government.\" Mr Blair on Sunday dismissed claims of broken promises, saying: \"I\\'ve dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don\\'t do deals over jobs like this - you don\\'t.\"\\n\\nIn a separate BBC interview, Mr Brown said he and the prime minister would not be distracted by \"gossip\". \"It\\'s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government,\" he said.\\n\\nOn Monday, Mr Blair\\'s spokesman said: \"The prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.\" Mr Brown says he discussed the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and promised to play his part.\\n\\nMr Peston said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\". Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters\\' trust because of the Iraq war.\\n\\nHe had then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from Cabinet allies and suspicion that the chancellor was manoeuvring against him. Mr Brown allegedly said he could no longer believe anything Mr Blair told him. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox likened the two men to \"self-obsessed schoolboys\". Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said their personal ambition was \"getting in the way of good government\".

       " 'Argentina closes $102.6bn debt swap\\n\\nArgentina is set to close its $102.6bn (Â£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal.\\n\\nThe estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government\\'s offer. Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history. Yesterday Argentina\\'s economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). Argentina\\'s President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: \"A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational.\" But he added that his government was close to achieving: \"The best debt renegotiation in history.\" The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years. If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders. About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country\\'s credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment. Of Argentina\\'s bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in Germany and 3.1% in Japan. Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country. The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors, who will benefit if Argentina\\'s economy becomes more stable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Halo 2 heralds traffic explosion\\n\\nThe growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company Sandvine.\\n\\nIt issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the Xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of Halo 2. The 9 November traffic explosion has continued into December, said Sandvine. Service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. As well as being a popular single-player title, Halo 2 can be connected to Microsoft\\'s subscription-based broadband network, Xbox Live. Gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare.\\n\\nBut the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said Sandvine\\'s chief technology officer Marc Morin.\\n\\nIn a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. It could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. \"The explosion in Xbox Live traffic attributed to Halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,\" he said. \"ISPs need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games,\" he added.\\n\\nOne of the main factors that spoils online gaming is \"lag\" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. Gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest \"lag\". Analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said Lindsay Schroth, an analyst with research firm The Yankee Group. \"In the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,\" she said. In countries such as Korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular.\\n',\n",

In October, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. India has a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets.\\n\\nIndia\\'s mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (Â£178m) by 2009, according to the report. Mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. Analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009, generating billions for mobile companies.\\n\\nServices other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in India have, as a result of the huge rise in subscribers, grown significantly and rapidly. \"The growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians, and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models,\" said Clint Wheelock, director of In-Stat/MDR\\'s wireless research group.\\n\\n\"Mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers, and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players.\" Currently, India has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers, said the report. According to In-Stat/MDR, it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth.\\n\\nIn January 2003, there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in India. Many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. Despite this, the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. Less than 20% of India\\'s total population own a mobile in India, compared to well over 50% in most European countries. The trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies, which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators.\\n',\n",

For Andrea Arnold, who won the category, Ashvin Kumar and Gary McKendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight.\\n\\nArnold\\'s gritty drama Wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while Kumar\\'s Little Terrorist follows a young Pakistani Muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed Indian border. McKendry\\'s entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy\\'s headquarters in Beverly Hills. \"I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I\\'ve ever seen,\" says Arnold.\\n\\nSet in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she\\'s on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby\\'s mouth. \"The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can\\'t shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,\" she explains.\\n\\nSince she presented children\\'s TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. \"I\\'m not interested in the publicity. It\\'s not my personality. I\\'m overwhelmed by all the fuss,\" she said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. \"But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I\\'d still be proud of it - even if it hadn\\'t won any.\" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels \"flattered and honoured\". \"We\\'ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can\\'t get it in perspective yet. I\\'m still reeling.\"\\n\\nAnd she won\\'t commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. \"I\\'m just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day.\" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. \"People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn\\'t stop ringing for a week after I got nominated.\" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. \"You\\'re left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much.\" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.\\n',\n",
       " 'Lib Dems target the student vote\\n\\nStudents can decide the fate of MPs in some seats at the next election, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has claimed.\\n\\nThe party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll. The figures assume all students will vote in their university town. In fact, some may vote where the parents live. The Lib Dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support. But the Tories would also end fees and Labour says both would cap people\\'s ambitions.\\n\\nThe Lib Dems have named the 14 seats where there are enough students to take the Lib Dems from second place to beat Labour, and the 13 where they could go from second to beat the Tories. Launching his campaign to win students\\' votes at the London School of Economics, Mr Kennedy urged students to \"make their mark\". He underlined Lib Dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to Â£2,000. He said: \"Top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background. \"And is it really right that so many young people are starting out in life with mortgage-style debts hanging round their necks?\" Mr Kennedy also said students want action on the environment and see the Iraq war, which his party opposed, as a defining issue.\\n\\nLabour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to Â£3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to Â£3,000. Ahead of Mr Kennedy\\'s launch, a Labour spokesperson said: \"Like the Tories, the Liberal Democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration, closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions. \"They are committed to abandoning Labour\\'s targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under Lib Dem plans students would even have to study near home.\" The Conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.\\n\\nThey say the Lib Dem policy would leave universities wholly dependent for their income on the \"goodwill\" of the chancellor.\\n\\nShadow education secretary Tim Collins is on Thursday setting out a new scheme of vocational grants for 14 to 16-year-olds to tackle what he says are \"crippling skills shortages\". The Lib Dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university, not in their home towns. Although the expected 5 May election would be during term time, students can vote by post. The Electoral Commission and National Union of Students are worried students in halls of residence can find it hard to register to vote. Some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered. If the election is on 5 May, voters need to register by 11 March.\\n\\n\\n - The seats where the Lib Dems say student votes can swing the election for them are: Bristol West, Cardiff Central, Leeds North West, Cambridge, Manchester Gorton, Sheffield Central, Oxford East, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central, Liverpool Riverside, Holborn and St Pancras, Oldham East and Saddleworth, Manchester Withington, Islington South and Finsbury, Birmingham Yardley, Surrey South West, Taunton, Orpington, Haltemprice and Howden, Eastbourne, Isle of Wight, Dorset West, Bournemouth East, Wells, Canterbury, Cities of London and Westminster, Bournemouth West, Westmorland and Lonsdale.\\n',\n",
       " 'Yahoo celebrates a decade online\\n\\nYahoo, one of the net\\'s most iconic companies, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week.\\n\\nThe web portal has undergone remarkable change since it was set up by Stanford University students David Filo and Jerry Yang in a campus trailer. The students wanted a way of keeping track of their web-based interests. The categories lists they devised soon became popular to hundreds of people and the two saw business potential in their idea.\\n\\nOriginally dubbed \"Jerry\\'s Guide to the World Wide Web\" the firm adopted the moniker Yahoo because the founders liked the dictionary definition of a yahoo as a rude, unsophisticated, uncouth person. The term was popularised by the 18th Century satirist Jonathan Swift in his classic novel, Gulliver\\'s Travels. \"We were certainly not sophisticated or civilised,\" Mr Yang told reporters ahead of the anniversary, which will be officially recognised on 2 March.\\n\\nThey did have business brains however, and in April 1995 persuaded venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, which also invested in Apple Computer and Cisco Systems, to fund Yahoo to the tune of $2m (Â£1.04m). A second round of funding followed in the autumn and the company floated in April 1996 with less than 50 employees. Now the firm employs 7,600 workers and insists its dot com culture of \"work hard, play hard\" still remains. It is one of just a handful of survivors of the dot-com crash although it now faces intense rivalry from firms such as Google, MSN and AOL. Jerry Yang, who remains the firm\\'s \"Chief Yahoo\", is proud of what the company has achieved. \"In just one decade, the internet has changed the way consumers do just about everything - and it\\'s been a remarkable and wonderful experience,\" he said. Through it all, we wanted to build products that satisfied our users wants and needs, but it\\'s even more than that - it\\'s to help every one of us to discover, get more done, share and interact.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'What now for British tennis?\\n\\nTim Henman\\'s decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.\\n\\nThe world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain\\'s last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told BBC Sport: \"After Tim\\'s announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.\" But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport\\'s premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.\\n\\nMurray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: \"Now we\\'ve dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.\" Britain\\'s next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: \"It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg\\'s growing years. \"I\\'m confident about the future. I wouldn\\'t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I\\'d imagine in five years time we\\'ll be competing for the major honours.\" Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. \"Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim\\'s mantle,\" said Bailey. \"He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he\\'s said in the past.\" Bogdanovic, three years Murray\\'s senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain\\'s Davis Cup umbrella.\\n\\nWhile Murray has been marked out as Britain\\'s golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: \"Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. \"They\\'re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. \"The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. \"Now they\\'ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I\\'m confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Cable offers video-on-demand\\n\\nCable firms NTL and Telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable TV heats up.\\n\\nMovies from Sony Pictures, Walt Disney, Touchstone, Miramax, Columbia and Buena Vista will be among those on offer. The service is similar to Sky Plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet. It could sound the death knell for some TV channels, Telewest predicts. \"It allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over Sky for the first time in many years,\" said Telewest chief executive Eric Tveter.\\n\\n\"Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV. There will be less compromising around the TV schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside,\" said Philip Snalune, director of products at Telewest. Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental. During the year, the service will be extended to all cable regions. Films will range in price from Â£1 or Â£2 for archived movies to Â£3.50 for current releases. New releases initially on offer will include 50 First dates, Kill Bill: Volume 2, Gothika and The Station Agent. In addition, NTL is offering children\\'s programmes, adult content, music video and concerts. Telewest will launch similar services later in the year. NTL is also offering viewers the chance to catch up with programmes they have missed. Its pick of the week service will offer a selection of BBC programmes from the previous seven days such as Eastenders, Casualty, Top Gear and Antiques Roadshow. The BBC is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their PC. For Telewest it is the beginning of a Â£20m investment in TV-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (PVR). PVR has been a big success for Sky because it gives customers control over programmes. Satellite customers without PVR cannot pause, rewind or fast forward their programmes.\\n\\nWith both services on offer from Telewest, Mr Tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial TV but also gain a huge competitive advantage over Sky.\\n\\n\"We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR,\" he said. Video rental stores may also have to watch their back. \"Video-on-demand is better than having a video-store in your living room and is more convenient,\" he said. NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand. \"PVR is a recording mechanism whereas what we are offering is truly on demand,\" said a spokesman for the company. Video-on-demand has the added advantage of not requiring a separate set-top box or extra remote controls, he added. Adam Thomas, an analyst at research firm Informa Media believes the time is ripe for video-on-demand to flourish. \"While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky\\'s lead,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Britons growing \\'digitally obese\\'\\n\\nGadget lovers are so hungry for digital data many are carrying the equivalent of 10 trucks full of paper in \"weight\".\\n\\nMusic, images, e-mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), a Toshiba study found. It found that more than 60% kept 1,000 to 2,000 music files on their devices, making the UK \"digitally fat\". \"Virtual weight\" measurements are based on research by California Institute of Technology professor Roy Williams. He calculated physical comparisons for digital data in the mid-1990s. He worked out that one gigabyte (1,000,000,000 bytes) was the equivalent of a pick-up truck filled with paper. The amount of data people are squirreling away on their gadgets is clearly a sign that people are finding more things to do with their shiny things.\\n\\nIf digital hoarding habits continue on this scale, people could be carrying around a \"digitally obese\" 20 gigabytes by next year. \"Britain has become a nation of information hoarders with a ferocious appetite for data,\" said Martin Larsson, general manager of Toshiba\\'s European storage device division.\\n\\n\"As storage capabilities increase and the features and functionalities of mobile devices expand to support movie files and entire libraries of multi-media content, we will all become virtually obese,\" he told the BBC News website. The survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built-in hard drives like music and media players from Apple, Creative Labs, Archos, iRiver and others. This trend is set to grow, according to analysts. They suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006. \"Consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality, and industry is trying to keep up,\" said Mr Larsson. \"People are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e-mailing, music, photos and more.\"\\n\\nMany are finding memory keys and memory sticks are simply not big enough to hold everything.\\n\\n\"Floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don\\'t have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices,\" said Mr Larsson. The cost of making hard drives has dropped and is continuing to do so because of improved technologies so they are proving to be more cost-effective than other forms of memory, he added. The amount of data that can be stored has grown by 400% in the last three years, while the cost for every gigabyte has fallen by 80%. It is also getting easier to transfer files from one device to another, which has traditionally been a slow and problematic area. \"Transfer of data between different memory types has improved significantly in recent times, and will be further helped by the standards for hard drives which are currently being developed by the major manufacturers,\" said Mr Larsson. According to technology analysts IDC, a fifth of all hard drives produced will be used in consumer electronics by 2007.\\n',\n",

Earlier, Conservative MP Michael Mates joined calls for a probe into claims Lord Goldsmith\\'s statement to Parliament was drawn up at Number 10. Mr Blair said the statement was a \"fair summary\" of Lord Goldsmith\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that\\'s what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,\" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with \"literally scores of times and the position has not changed\". Lord Goldsmith has denied being \"leaned on\" and says the words written were his.\\n\\nThe government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: \"That, as a general rule, is right, but it\\'s not an absolute rule.\" He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charles\\'s marriage plans. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said.\\n\\nMr Mates added: \"We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers\\' advice to the government has been published. \"And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.\" This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: \"Firstly, we haven\\'t broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it.\" In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair\\'s Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.\\n\\nBut a short statement about Lord Goldsmith\\'s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. Mr Sands\\' book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She told the BBC the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code.\\n\\n\"My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened,\" she said. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been \"written by or at Number 10\". \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions,\" he said.\\n',\n",

       " 'Looks and music to drive mobiles\\n\\nMobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts Gartner.\\n\\nMore than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. The figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, Gartner said. Good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. Although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to Gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.\\n\\n\"All the markets grew apart from Japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western Europe,\" mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi told the BBC News website. \"Japan is where north America and western European markets can be in a couple of years\\' time. \"They already have TV, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones.\"\\n\\nBut there could be a slight slowdown in sales in European and US markets too, according to Gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. This means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said Gartner. Third generation mobiles (3G) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but Ms Milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. \"At the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don\\'t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical.\" Nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. The majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.\\n\\nMore likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. The Motorola Razr V3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. This was not a \"women\\'s thing\", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. It was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. \"Western Europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,\" said Ms Milanesi.\\n\\n\"People are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. \"This year music will have a part to play in this.\" The market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (Â£10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (Â£9.4 million) by 2009, according to Jupiter Research. Sony Ericsson just released its Walkman branded mobile phone, the W800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours\\' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. In July last year, Motorola and Apple announced a version of iTunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with Motorola mobile phones. Apple said the new iTunes music player would become Motorola\\'s standard music application for its music phones. But the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the iPod. Ms Milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. But they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.\\n',\n",
       " 'Johnny Depp: The acting outlaw\\n\\nJohnny Depp, whose latest role was Peter Pan creator JM Barrie in Finding Neverland, is celebrated as one of Hollywood\\'s most maverick talents. Depp has become an unlikely major star, given his preference for taking dark and idiosyncratic roles instead of surefire box office hits. He has had a long-running working relationship with the equally unconventional director Tim Burton. Depp was born in Kentucky in 1963 and at first wanted to be a rock star, playing in a number of bands and supporting acts such as Iggy Pop and The B-52s in Florida. On a visit to Los Angeles, his former wife introduced him to actor Nicolas Cage.\\n\\nIn 1984 he started his film career playing a doomed teenager in horror film Nightmare On Elm Street. Two years later he played a soldier in Oliver Stone\\'s Vietnam epic Platoon. But it was TV that first made Depp a star. He played undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the US series 21 Jump Street for three years from 1987.\\n\\nIn 1990 he began his partnership with Burton in the dark fairy tale Edward Scissorhands, about a young man with blades for hands. He won plaudits in 1993 for the downbeat film What\\'s Eating Gilbert Grape, where he played a sensitive youth looking after an overweight mother and a retarded younger brother, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Another role under Burton, Ed Wood, starred Depp as the crazed cult film-maker Wood, in 1994. He played a much more serious, sensitive role in his next major film, Donnie Brasco, where he portrayed an undercover cop infiltrating a mafia ring. In 1997 he directed his only film to date - The Brave, the story of an Indian man offered money to appear in a snuff film.\\n\\nTwo years later he played Hunter S Thompson in Terry Gilliam\\'s ambitious but poorly-received big screen adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. He worked again with Tim Burton in the 1999 horror film Sleepy Hollow, and appeared opposite Dame Judi Dench and Juliette Binoche in Chocolat. His performance in Pirates of the Caribbean, which earned him Golden Globe and Bafta nominations, had many critics thinking he based it upon the mannerisms of his friend, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. His latest role in Finding Neverland explored JM Barrie\\'s relationship with Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her children. Depp\\'s charismatic performance drew an audience of adults and children alike into Barrie\\'s vivid imagination, and he was called the \"fifth child of the group\" by the film\\'s director Marc Forster.\\n\\nHe has two children of his own with French singer Vanessa Paradis, having previously been in a long-term relationship with British model Kate Moss. The theme of children\\'s literature in Depp\\'s career - and his long association with Tim Burton - are set to continue in his next role, playing Willy Wonka in a remake of Roald Dahl\\'s classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. British TV comedy fans might also remember Depp\\'s guest role in the final episode of BBC sketch programme The Fast Show, cited as his favourite show. It was another surprise move in Depp\\'s varied and intriguing career.\\n',\n",

IBM said the money will fund a variety of technical, research and marketing initiatives to boost Linux use. IBM said it had taken the step in response to greater customer demand for the open source software.\\n\\nIn 2004 IBM said it had seen double digit growth in the number of customers using Linux to help staff work together more closely. The money will be used to help this push towards greater collaboration and will add Linux-based elements to IBM's Workplace software. Workplace is a suite of programs and tools that allow workers to get at core business applications no matter what device they use to connect to corporate networks. One of the main focuses of the initiative will be to make it easier to use Linux-based desktop computers and mobile devices with Workplace. Even before IBM announced this latest spending boost it was one of the biggest advocates of the open source way of working. In 2001 it put $300m into a three-year Linux program and has produced Linux versions of many of its programs. Linux and the open source software movement are based on the premise that developers should be free to tinker with the core components of software programs. They reason that more open scrutiny of software produces better programs and fuels innovation.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Rocker Doherty in on-stage fight\\n\\nRock singer Pete Doherty has been involved in a fight with his band\\'s guitarist at their biggest gig to date.\\n\\nBabyshambles played for 5,000 fans at London\\'s Brixton Academy on Tuesday. The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on Â£50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\\n\\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines\\' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There\\'s a few people getting hurt down the front, you\\'ve got to move back.\"\\n\\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden\\'s guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\". The singer was arrested with fellow musician Alan Wass on 2 February after an alleged dispute with documentary-maker Max Carlish at a London hotel. They are next due in court on 18 April.\\n',\n",
       " 'Giving financial gifts to children\\n\\nYour child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?\\n\\nGifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.\\n\\nThe government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund. The first vouchers, worth Â£250 or Â£500 for low-income families, will be distributed from January. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005.\\n\\nParents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to Â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children\\'s deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.\\n\\nThere are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of Â£1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at Â£1.\\n\\nInterest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (Â£4,745 for the current tax year).\\n\\nIf the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. When the account is opened a form \"R85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.\\n\\nThe tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only Â£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children\\'s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents\\' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. Therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the Child Trust Fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual Â£1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.\\n\\nAnother favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. The parent or guardian will be responsible for the Bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child\\'s guardian. The minimum for each purchase is Â£100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of Â£10.\\n\\nThere are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.\\n\\nOver the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. One of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. One way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. These are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. These funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the FTSE 100. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. These are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). The difference is that the charges are quite low. The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. For larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.\\n',\n",
       " 'Broadband in the UK growing fast\\n\\nHigh-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.\\n\\nBT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.\\n\\nAccording to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK\\'s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.\\n\\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. \"This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,\" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer\\'s home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.\\n',\n",
       " 'Man Utd to open books to Glazer\\n\\nManchester United\\'s board has agreed to give US tycoon Malcolm Glazer access to its books.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. In a statement, the club said it would allow Mr Glazer \"limited due diligence\" to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer\\'s plans, calling his assumptions \"aggressive\" and his plan \"damaging\". Many of Manchester United\\'s supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. About 300 fans protested outside the Old Trafford ground two days ago.\\n\\nRival local club Manchester City has pleaded with visiting fans not to protest inside its ground when the two teams play a televised match on Sunday.\\n\\nManchester United\\'s response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. \"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal,\" the club said in its statement. Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that \"the board is likely to regard as fair\" and on terms which \"may be deliverable\". But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer\\'s proposal. \"The board continues to believe that Mr Glazer\\'s business plan assumptions are aggressive,\" the statement said, \"and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.\" Whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of Manchester United many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United\\'s second biggest shareholders. They own the successful Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team based in Florida. If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club\\'s biggest shareholders.\\n\\nIrish horse racing millionaires JP McManus and John Magnier own 29% of United through their investment vehicle Cubic Expression, and have yet to express a view on the bid approach.\\n\\nA group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. They have signed a House of Commons motion, and Tony Lloyd, the Manchester Central MP, whose constituency includes the club\\'s Old Trafford ground, has pledged to take the matter \"to Tony Blair if necessary\". The Commons motion says \"any takeover designed to transform the club into a private company would be against the interests of those supporters and football\". However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. A spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the Enterprise Act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non-competition grounds. Mr Glazer\\'s offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.\\n',\n",

Any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys, with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board.\\n\\nJarek Kujda, one of the project\\'s founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now.\\n\\n\"I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine,\" said Kujda. He realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. He wondered, if one GameBoy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born. \"Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project,\" said Kudja. \"We prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert.\" The group plays maybe four or five shows a year. Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek\\'s younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise. \"For example, I make music with more hard beats and noises,\" she said. \"But each of us makes another music, a different sound. And then in the concert we just improvise, and that I think is more fun for us.\"\\n\\nThe Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. Some love the group\\'s music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it.\\n\\nIn the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. But Jarek Kujda says they try to be unique. \"We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum,\" he said. \"We want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. We\\'re something like an electronic jam session.\" The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project\\'s tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year. And they have sponsorship, courtesy of the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon.

       " 'Remote control rifle range debuts\\n\\nSoon you could go hunting via the net.\\n\\nA Texas company is considering letting web users use a remote-controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. For a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133-hectare Texas ranch. The Live-Shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.\\n\\nJohn Underwood, the man behind the Live-Shot website, said the idea for the remote-control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. \"We were looking at a beautiful white-tail buck and my friend said \\'If you just had a gun for that\\'. A little light bulb went off in my head,\" Mr Underwood told the Reuters news agency. A year\\'s work and $10,000 has resulted in a remote-controlled rig on which sits a camera and .22 calibre rifle. Mr Underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his Texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. Also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig. Each remote hunting session will cost $150 with additional fees for meat processing and taxidermy work. Species that can be shot will include barbary, Corsican and mouflon sheep, blackbuck antelope and wild pigs. Already the Live-Shot site lets people shoot 10 rounds at paper and silhouette targets for $5.95 for each 20-minute shooting session. For further fees, users can get the target they shot and a DVD recording of their session. Handlers oversee each shooting session and can stop the gun being fired if it is being aimed off-range or at something it should not be. Mr Underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to Texas. In a statement the RSPCA said it had \"grave concerns\" about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle. \"We assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a \\'clean kill\\', something the RSPCA accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport,\" it said. \"Animals hit but not killed would without doubt be caused to suffer unnecessarily,\" said the statement. Mike Berger, wildlife director of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. He said state laws on hunting only covered \"regulated animals\" such as native deer and bird species. As such there was nothing to stop Mr Underwood letting people hunt \"unregulated\" imported animals and wild pigs. Mr Underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.\\n',\n",

They were detained in the Cuban camp as part of the US-led \"war on terror\". Mr Straw said the US had agreed to release the four after \"intensive and complex discussions\" over security. He said the government had been negotiating the return of the detainees since 2003. All four families have been informed of their return and have been involved in regular discussions with the government, Mr Straw said.\\n\\nBut he added: \"Once they are back in the UK, the police will consider whether to arrest them under the Terrorism Act 2000 for questioning in connection with possible terrorist activity.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, welcomed the return of the four detainees. But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said the four had been rescued from a \"legal no-man\\'s land\". \"Their civil rights were systematically and deliberately abused and they were denied due process.\"\\n\\nAzmat Begg, father of Moazzam, thanked his lawyers and the British people for the support he had received while campaigning for his son\\'s release. He added: \"If they have done something wrong, of course they should be punished, but if they haven\\'t, they shouldn\\'t have been there.\" Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. She said: \"They should at the outset have said quite clearly to the American government that they were behaving in breach of international law and that the British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down. \"They didn\\'t do that. They colluded with it.\" Moazzam Begg\\'s Labour MP Roger Godsiff welcomed his release, but said questions remained unanswered, particularly about charges. Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it\\'s found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money. \"I don\\'t see any difference in this case.\" Human rights campaigners have been outraged at the treatment of the detainees in Cuba. Amnesty International has called Camp Delta a \"major human-rights scandal\" and an \"icon of lawlessness\". Both Amnesty and the lobby group Guantanamo Human Rights Commission described the release as \"long overdue\". Civil rights group Liberty said it was \"delighted\" but called on the government to release men indefinitely detained in the UK without charge or trial.\\n\\nDirector Shami Chakrabarti called on the government to \"practise what it preaches\" and either free or charge 12 detainees at Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons. Law Lords ruled last month that the 12 were being held in contravention of human rights laws but they are still behind bars. The US has also announced that 48-year-old Australian Mamdouh Habib, previously accused of terrorist offences, will be released without charge from Camp Delta. Five British detainees released from Guantanamo in March last year were questioned by UK police before being released without charge.\\n',\n",

He is widely credited with helping to create and popularise the so-called god-game genre.\\n\\nSpeaking to the BBC News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. It\\'s come completely out of the blue,\" he said, \"I never would have guessed that I\\'d have that kind of honour.\" He said he was surprised as much because, not too long ago, many people thought computer gaming was a fad.\\n\\n\"It was thought to be like skateboarding,\" he said, \"a craze that everyone thought would go away.\" Now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. \"Britain plays a big part in it,\" he said. \"It\\'s one of the founding nations that made the industry what it is.\" Mr Molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years. His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games. The title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people. Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career. \"I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird,\" he said, \"but it became a huge international success.\" He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black & White. One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film. The veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve. \"Being an absolute geek I\\'ve got no idea what I\\'m going to wear when I go and pick it up,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Thanou bullish over drugs hearing\\n\\nKaterina Thanou is confident she and fellow sprinter Kostas Kenteris will not be punished for missing drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.\\n\\nThe Greek pair appeared at a hearing on Saturday which will determine whether their provisional bans from athletics\\' ruling body the IAAF should stand. \"After five months we finally had the chance to give explanations. I am confident and optimistic,\" said Thanou. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\"\\n\\nThe athletes\\' lawyer Grigoris Ioanidis said he believed the independent disciplinary committee set up by the Greek Athletics Federation (SEGAS) would find them innocent. \"We are almost certain that the charges will be dropped,\" said Ioanidis.\\n\\n\"We believe that we have presented [a case] that the charges are unreasonable.\" Thanou, the 2000 Olympic women\\'s 100m silver medallist, and Sydney 200m champion Kenteris were suspended by the IAAF for missing three drugs tests. The third was supposed to take place on the eve of the Athens Games last August, but the pair could not be found in the athletes\\' village. They were later taken to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. Thanou\\'s coach Christos Tzekos was also suspended by the IAAF. \"We were asked [by the disciplinary committee] all kinds of questions about the night of 12 August,\" said Tzekos. \"We did not leave any gaps. As far as I am concerned there is no such issue [of refusing to be tested], and I am very optimistic.\" Tzekos, Thanou and Kenteris, who have all denied the charges, can expect a decision within a month. \"Deliberations will start after some additional documents are brought in by Thursday,\" said committee chairman Kostas Panagopoulos. \"I estimate that the final ruling will be issued by the end of February.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Games maker fights for survival\\n\\nOne of Britain\\'s largest independent game makers, Argonaut Games, has been put up for sale.\\n\\nThe London-based company behind the Harry Potter games has sacked about 100 employees due to a severe cash crisis. The administrators told BBC News Online that selling Argonaut was the only way to save it as it had run out of cash. Argonaut warned that it was low on cash 10 days ago when its shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange.\\n\\nArgonaut has been making games for some 18 years and is one the largest independent games developers in the UK.\\n\\nAlong with its headquarters in north London, it operates studios in Cambridge and Sheffield. Argonaut was behind the Harry Potter games which provided a healthy flow of cash into the company. But, like all software developers, Argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. Signs that it was in trouble emerged in August, when it warned it was heading for losses of Â£6m in the financial year due to delays in signing new contracts for games. Those new deals were further delayed, leading Argonaut to warn in mid-October that it was running out of cash and suspend trading of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. As part of cost-cutting measures, some 100 employees were fired. \"When the news about the Â£6m loss came out, we knew there were going to be redundancies,\" said Jason Parkinson, one of the game developers sacked by Argonaut. \"A lot of people suspected that Argonaut had been in trouble for some time,\" he told BBC News Online. Mr Parkinson said staff were told the job losses were necessary to save Argonaut from going under. At the start of the year, the company employed 268 people. After the latest round of cuts there are 80 staff at Argonaut headquarters in Edgware in north London, with 17 at its Morpheme offices in Kentish Town, London, and 22 at the Just Add Monsters base in Cambridge.\\n\\nArgonaut called in administrators David Rubin & Partners on Friday to find a way to rescue the company from collapse. It spent the weekend going over the company\\'s finances and concluded that the only way to save the business was to put it up for sale. The administrator told BBC News Online that the costs of restructuing would be too high, partly because of the overheads from the company\\'s four premises across the UK. It said it was hopeful that it could save some 110 jobs by selling the business, saying it had had expressions of interest from several quarters and were looking for a quick sale. The administrator said it would ensure that staff made redundant would receive any wages, redundancy or holiday pay due to them, hopefully by Christmas.\\n',\n",
       " 'House prices show slight increase\\n\\nPrices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society.\\n\\nThe figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of England figures have shown.\\n\\nNationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. \"We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared,\" said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.\\n\\nThe price of an average UK property now stands at Â£152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.\\n\\n\"I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline.\" House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.\\n\\nFurther evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004. Overall, mortgage lending rose by Â£7.2bn in January, marginally up on the Â£7.1bn rise in December.\\n',\n",
       " 'Karachi stocks hit historic high\\n\\nThe Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.\\n\\nThe index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom. The KSE index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since Monday morning.\\n\\nIn 2002, the KSE was the world\\'s best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.\\n\\nPakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. Jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on Tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 January. Others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any time\". \"That\\'s rubbish,\" KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. \"Whenever the market reflects Pakistan\\'s true economic reality, it is described as a bubble.\" Mr Lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.\\n\\nMarket analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the KSE\\'s performance. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan\\'s credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. Standard & Poor\\'s upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. There are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of February.\\n\\nThen, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market\\'s performance,\" says Mr Lakhani. One leading Karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. \"If you file a $1.3 trillion case against Saudi money after 9/11, Arab money will not go to the US any more.\" A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.\\n\\nLocally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market\\'s advantage.\\n\\nAn anti-Musharraf campaign threatened by the MMA, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. The release of Asif Zardari, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto\\'s husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition Pakistan People\\'s Party. Most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. This, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. The market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the US, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the South Asian neighbours. \"You can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"Let us see how long one can reap its benefits.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Global blogger action day called\\n\\nThe global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.\\n\\nThe month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers\\' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. \"I hope this day will focus people,\" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.\\n\\nThe group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other \"cyber-dissidents\". \"If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except \\'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\\',\" said Mr Hopkins. \"That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. \"If you don\\'t have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.\" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.\\n\\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers\\' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.\\n\\nThe Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. \"Blogging is in this weird no man\\'s land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. \"But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.\"\\n\\nIt is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.\\n\\n\"This is a big messy argument,\" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: \"It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs.\" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, \"is part of the whole messy conversation.\" \"If you haven\\'t already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don\\'t have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. \"Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,\" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. \"That is the essential difference. What I call \\'templating software\\' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. \"You don\\'t even have to have your own computer.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Warnings on woeful wi-fi security\\n\\nCompanies are getting worse at keeping their wireless data networks secure.\\n\\nA survey of wi-fi networks in London, Frankfurt, New York and San Francisco by RSA Security found more than a third had basic security features turned off. By contrast last year\\'s survey found that 15% of firms had failed to take basic steps to improve security. RSA warned that wi-fi\\'s growing popularity made it much more likely that insecure networks would be found and exploited.\\n\\nWireless or wi-fi networks have become hugely popular over the last few years in offices because they are easy to set up and make going online much more convenient. This popularity shows no sign of slowing reveals the annual RSA Security and NetSurity survey which found an annual 66% growth rate in the number of wireless nets being installed in London and Frankfurt. Although most firms do take steps to turn on the security functions built in to the wi-fi standard and protect themselves from attack, the survey found that a significant proportion were taking unnecessary risks. On average 33% of the wireless networks found by RSA and NetSurity researchers in London, Frankfurt, New York and San Francisco had not used basic security systems. Many firms were simply turning on their wireless net access points and use default settings that anyone familiar with wi-fi could easily find out. RSA said that 26% of wi-fi networks found London used default settings compared to 30% in Frankfurt, 31% in New York and 28% in San Francisco. Many users of wi-fi nets did not even turn on the encryption that scrambles data traffic between users and the access point helping them go online. This is despite a series of stories warning firms about the dangers of \"drive-by hacking\" in which computer criminals walk or drive around city centres using easy to use tools to spot wi-fi nets. \"These figures are another stark warning to unsecured businesses to get their act together,\" said Phil Cracknell, chief technology officer at NetSurity. As more public wi-fi hotspots appear and people become more familiar with using them, it was getting more likely that insecure would be found, warned Mr Cracknell. \"Accidental or intentional connection to a corporate network can bring with it a series of security issues including loss of confidential data and installation of malicious code,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'New drink limit \\'would cut toll\\'\\n\\nMore lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink-drive limits by a third, a report says.\\n\\nUniversity College London research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year. The findings are being published by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs are due to vote on the government\\'s Road Safety Bill. The bill includes changes to speeding fines but not to the drink-drive limit. The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK\\'s roads compared with 2003. He estimates that this would save the country Â£119m a year.\\n\\nA previous estimate, contained in a 1998 Department of Transport Document, suggested such a move could save 50 lives a year. The findings are based on the assumption that drivers who currently keep below the legal limit would continue to do so were it to be lowered and that those who tend to exceed the limit slightly would also lower their drinking. Professor Allsop said: \"Reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver\\'s BAC [blood alcohol content] is within 30mg of the current limit. \"Only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.\"\\n\\nMinisters do not support a lower limit, saying it is not clear it would have a major impact on drink drive casualties. They believe educating drivers is more important. The AA Motoring Trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers\\' attitudes to drink-driving. Road safety head Andrew Howard said: \"It remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.\\n\\n\"Parliamentarians need to consider this carefully. Britons police themselves by consensus much more effectively than they do by weight of enforcement alone.\" Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso said drink-driving remained a \"major killer\", with figures showing a worrying rise in the number of accidents involving drivers who had been drinking. He said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink-driving. The Road Safety Bill, which gets its second reading on Tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court - currently a blood test is needed. It also includes plans for a staggered speeding fines and points system, penalising drivers who exceed limits by a wide margin more than those who are caught going just over. These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth Dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. In an article for the Times newspaper, Ms Dunwoody, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, says: \"Slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. \"It is quite simple: if you hit someone at 30mph, they have a 50 per cent chance of survival. If you are going at 40mph, nine times out of ten they will die.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'EU software patent law faces axe\\n\\nThe European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\\n\\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\\n\\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.\\n',\n",

He is expected to be transferred to a state prison while a decision is made on whether he should be released. Mr Knight, founder of Death Row Records, served a 10-month jail term in 2004 for punching a man while on parole for an assault conviction. Police said Mr Knight was stopped on Saturday after performing an illegal U-turn and a search of his car allegedly found marijuana.\\n\\nHe is also accused of not having insurance. A 18-year-old woman in the car was arrested for providing false information and having a fake ID card. She was later released. It was his second alleged violation, having previously served half of a nine-year sentence for breaking the terms of his parole. Mr Knight, 39, was jailed in October 1996 following his involvement in a fight with a rival gang just hours before rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a Las Vegas drive-by shooting. He was driving Shakur\\'s car at the time and was shot in the head. At the time he was on probation for assaulting two musicians. Mr Knight, a former bodyguard, set up Death Row records in the early 1990s with Shakur and Dr Dre among his protegees.

The company, which is vying with Mercedes-Benz for the title of leading premium carmaker, is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005. It is launching a revamped version of its 3-Series saloon class next month.\\n\\nBMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003.\\n\\nBMW-brand sales rose 2.3% to 80,600 while sales of Mini models rose 3.6% to 14,800. There was also a significant increase in sales of Rolls-Royces on the continent. BMW sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year. The German carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in Asia to 150,000 by 2008. \"Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features,\" said Helmut Panke, BMW\\'s group chief executive.\\n\\nChina remains the main area of concern for BMW after sales there fell 16% last year. However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends.

About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox.\\n\\nThe thrust of this year\\'s show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. \"The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,\" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. \"It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.\"\\n\\nConsumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. \"This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. \"Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,\" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the \"democratisation\" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple\\'s iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.\\n\\nThe CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft\\'s Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.\\n',\n",

The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August. Other winners included Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which took the Most Wanted for Christmas prize. Only released last week, it was closely followed by Halo 2 and Half-Life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.\\n\\nBut they missed out on the prize for the Most Wanted game of 2005, which went to the Nintendo title, The Legend of Zelda. The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics. It helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (Â£8.3m). The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam. The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004. Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week. It was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. Electronic Arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from Nintendo which won in 2003. The annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. Games awards like this have grown in importance. Over the last six years, the UK market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record Â£1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts Screen Digest.\\n\",\n",

Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend. \"Christian Andersen\\'s fairy tales are timeless and universal,\" said Jarre. \"For all of us, at any age there is always - beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale - a message to learn.\" There are year-long celebrations planned across the world to celebrate Andersen and his work, which includes The Emperor\\'s New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. Denmark\\'s Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities. The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom \"the international icon we thought we knew so well\".\\n\\n\"Bloom recognizes the darker aspects of Andersen\\'s authorship,\" Prince Frederik said. Bloom is to be formally presented with the Hans Christian Andersen Award this spring in Anderson\\'s hometown of Odense.

Owning all 10 gadgets will set the gadget lover back Â£7,455. That is Â£1,000 cheaper than last year\\'s list due to falling manufacturing costs making gadgets more affordable.\\n\\nPortable gadgets dominate the list, including Sharp\\'s 902 3G mobile phone, the Pentax Optio SV digital camera and Samsung\\'s Yepp YH-999 video jukebox.\\n\\n\"What this year\\'s Essentials shows is that gadgets are now cheaper, sexier and more indispensable than ever. We\\'ve got to the point where we can\\'t live our lives without certain technology,\" said Adam Vaughan, editor of Stuff Essentials. The proliferation of gadgets in our homes is inexorably altering the role of the high street in our lives thinks Mr Vaughan. \"Take digital cameras, who would now pay to develop an entire film of photos? Or legitimate downloads, who would travel miles to a record shop when they could download the song in minutes for 70p?\" he asks. Next year will see a new set of technologies capturing the imaginations of gadget lovers, Stuff predicts. The Xbox 2, high-definition TV and MP3 mobiles will be among the list of must-haves that will dominate 2006, it says. The spring launch of the PSP in the UK is eagerly awaited by gaming fans.\\n',\n",
       " 'Levy takes Whitbread novel prize\\n\\nOrange Prize winner Andrea Levy has seen her book Small Island win the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award.\\n\\nShe is now favourite to win the overall prize after beating Booker winner Alan Hollinghurst\\'s The Line of Beauty. Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children\\'s fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World. All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a Â£25,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening.\\n\\nBookmaker William Hill has placed London-based Levy\\'s novel as the 6/4 favourite to win.\\n\\nSmall Island, Levy\\'s fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. \"What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It\\'s hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone\\'s fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: \"It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. \"Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch.\"\\n\\nIn the biography category it was John Guy\\'s The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\". Guy has published many histories, including Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003. Michael Symmons Roberts\\' fourth collection of poems scooped the poetry award. His works mixes mysticism, erotica and philosophy through life, death and resurrection. As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary films. Children\\'s winner McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the Whitbread Prize in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust. She has previously been the winner of the Blue Peter Book of the Year.\\n',\n",
       " 'Parmalat sues 45 banks over crash\\n\\nParmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit Italian dairy company went bust last year.\\n\\nThe firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; Â£10bn) and new boss Enrico Bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. He claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. Parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. Under Italian law, administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency, if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. The firm also said it is preparing further law suits.\\n\\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, 35 of the companies sued on Thursday are Italian while the remaining 10 are international. The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. Among those already targeted are Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton. They have all denied any wrongdoing. Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. In the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company, among other things, had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. That enabled Parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas, allowing it to become a darling of the Italian stock exchange.\\n',\n",
       " 'Solutions to net security fears\\n\\nFake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.\\n\\nTrust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think the threat is overplayed,\" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. He added: \"The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.\" Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. \"Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us,\" he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual\\'s identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.\\n\\nOn average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.\\n\\nActivcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard\\'s method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.\\n\\n\"The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both.\" The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. \"You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. \"If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction.\" The clever bit happens back at the bank\\'s secure servers. The code is validated by the bank\\'s systems, matching the information they expect with the customer\\'s unique key. \"Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,\" said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. \"By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can\\'t prove who they are,\" according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. \"PCs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards.\" The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. \"The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,\" he said.\\n',\n",

       " \"Can Smith work Scottish wonders?\\n\\nThe worst kept secret in Scottish football was revealed on Thursday when Walter Smith was named as the new national manager.\\n\\nFrom the moment Berti Vogts' miserable tenure in charge of Scotland ended, the former Rangers and Everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. But is Smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football? The 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. Scotland have not reached a major finals since the World Cup in 1998 and reaching Germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. And the Fifa rankings see Scotland listed at an all time low of 77th, below the likes of Estonia, Ghana, Angola and Thailand. Scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so Smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. Smith's track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. The man who was Alex Ferguson's assistant when Scotland played at the 1986 World Cup won seven league titles with Rangers. And his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games' top names, including Ferguson and Graeme Souness, who took him to Ibrox as his assistant in 1986. Characters like Souness, Ferguson and current Ibrox manager Alex McLeish all cite Smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the Scottish game.\\n\\nMuch was made of Vogts' inability to express himself to the players and media. That will certainly not be the case with Smith. The former Dundee United and Dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). But it should be remembered Vogts came to Scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a World Cup winner as a player and a European Championships winner as a manager. Smith will inherit the same problems Vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. And it remains to be seen if Smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of Vogts' preparation work. A fresh start for the Scottish national team was imperative and Smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. But will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...\\n\",\n",
       " 'Baghdad Blogger on big screen\\n\\nA film based on the internet musings of the \"Baghdad Blogger\" has been shown at the Rotterdam Film Festival.\\n\\nThe film has been directed by the man who calls himself Salam Pax, the author of the weblog about Iraqi life during and after the war. The movie version comes in the form of a series of shorts made by Pax on a hand-held camera. Baghdad Blogger is among a number of films about Iraq showcased at the Dutch festival, which runs until Sunday. Following the fascination with the writing of Salam Pax - not his real name - he began a regular column in The Guardian newspaper and was given a crash course in documentary film-making. For the film he travelled Iraq to document the changing landscape of the country and the problems it has faced since the invasion, speaking to ordinary Iraqis about their experiences. The festival will also see the screening of Underexposure, one of Iraq\\'s first features to emerge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nDirector Oday Rasheed made the film on discarded 1980s Kodak film taken from the remains for the former Ministry of Culture building. It centres on the lives of families and strangers going about their everyday business as Baghdad is under siege. Rasheed said the title was refers to the isolation felt by Iraqis under Saddam\\'s regime and the difficult time the country is now experiencing. \"Saddam\\'s regime was hell, but now I think the hell has doubled,\" Rasheed said. The festival was also due to screen murdered Dutch film-maker Theo Van Gogh\\'s film about the treatment of woman under Islam, but it was withdrawn due to safety fears. Van Gogh was shot and stabbed in November 2004, following death threats he received about his film Submission.\\n',\n",
       " 'Profile: David Blunkett\\n\\nBefore he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.\\n\\nHis responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.\\n\\nRecently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett\\'s own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a \"sense of belonging\" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and \"airy fairy libertarians\" and earlier in the year coined the phrase \"liberati\", as an amalgam of \"glitterati\" and \"liberal\". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .\\n\\nBefore the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don\\'t casually think I am available\". He added: \"I am not available because I am just getting on with the job.\" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party\\'s National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.\\n\\nMr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair\\'s first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett\\'s side.\\n',\n",

       " 'Film production \\'falls\\' 40% in UK\\n\\nThe number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said.\\n\\nTwenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.\\n\\nLast year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine\\'s executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to Â£9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\\n\\n\"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003\\'s record level of production could be bettered,\" the council\\'s spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to Â£4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.\\n',\n",

But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about Â£55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.\\n\\nThe tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill\\'s private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.\\n\\nA spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as \"very disappointing\", but pointed to some criticism of Merrill\\'s procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba\\'s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of \"laddish culture\" at the bank. \"We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,\" Merrill said in a statement. \"Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. \"Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.\"\\n\\nBased in London\\'s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill\\'s global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill\\'s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba\\'s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba\\'s division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.\\n',\n",

Twenty of his films are screening in a special retrospective during the festival, which runs until 20 February. The veteran film-maker, 68, won the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002 for Chihwaseon. \"Although his films vary in style, they all bear his unmistakable stamp: they are forceful and charged cinematographically, as well as reticent, stylised and musical,\" organisers said in a statement.

Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. Otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of China, he told MPs.\\n\\nThe chancellor said that the EU\\'s planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.\\n\\nUnder Mr Brown\\'s rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. He told the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee that the EU rules \"make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure\". But he argued that the EU was moving in the direction of the UK principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. Under Mr Brown\\'s \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.\\n\\nMr Brown vigorously denied Conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. In March the Office of National Statistics (ONS) reclassified Â£3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the Budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only Â£6bn. Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter. But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. Mr Brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. He told the Treasury Select Committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost Treasury coffers.\\n\\nEarlier, ex-Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. Speaking on Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules. But fellow Tory David Heathcoat-Amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run Europe\\'s varied economies on one set of rules. \"The essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,\" he said. \"The warning is about the European constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. It gives more powers to Brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy.\" But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. \"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Debate needed\\' on donations cap\\n\\nA cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.\\n\\nFears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a Â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\\n\\nThere were almost Â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly Â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than Â£1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be Â£10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned Â£56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\\n\\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under Â£200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to Â£3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\\n\\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from Â£20m to Â£15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.\\n',\n",
       " 'Millions to miss out on the net\\n\\nBy 2025, 40% of the UK\\'s population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.\\n\\nAround 23 million Britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant BT. It compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the UK, who are not currently online. The idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is \"wishful thinking\", the report concludes.\\n\\nThe study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. Although the percentage of Britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. As more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.\\n\\nThe gap between \"have-nets\" and \"have-nots\" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. BT set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. Optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. \"Internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,\" said Adrian Hosford, director of corporate responsibility at BT. Costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. \"There is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. They don\\'t have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,\" said Mr Hosford.\\n\\nAs now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.\\n\\nThose on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. Organisations such as BT have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said Mr Hosford. The telco has seen positive results with its Everybody Online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around Britain. In one area of Cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite CVs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained Mr Hosford. Such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. \"If we don\\'t address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they\\'ll simply not be able to keep up with society,\" he said. The Alliance for Digital Inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.\\n',\n",
       " 'FAO warns on impact of subsidies\\n\\nBillions of farmers\\' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN\\'s Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned.\\n\\nTrade barriers and subsidies \"severely\" distort the market, the FAO report on the \"State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004\" said. As a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. The most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. The FAO report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.\\n\\nThe FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries\\' access to the world market. It also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.\\n\\nAccording to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. Global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the European Union and the US, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. In fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (Â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. The market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the FAO said. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. These countries are mainly situated in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.\\n',\n",

But Ferguson said: \"I think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. \"It was a great opportunity - and we haven\\'t delivered.\" United went ahead through Alan Smith in the 33rd minute before Bouba Diop\\'s superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors\\' lead in the 87th minute. Ferguson described the result as an \"absolute giveaway\" after United had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter.

       " 'BMW reveals new models pipeline\\n\\nBMW is preparing to enter the market for car-style people carriers, the firm\\'s chief has told BBC News.\\n\\nSpeaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe. In contrast, he said, the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade. \"Customers are moving out of the mini-van (and) traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore,\" he said. \"We have decided that BMW will enter the [crossover] segment,\" he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker\\'s intentions.\\n\\nMr Panke praised the Honda Accura as the \"best execution\" yet of a crossover vehicle. \"We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment,\" he said.\\n\\nA decision on just how BMW will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005. Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008. The coming switch is driven in part by the need for successful carmakers to stay aware of trans-Atlantic differences in the car market, Mr Panke insisted. While in the US drivers tend to prefer sports utility vehicles (SUVs), such as the BMW X5 and its sibling X3, in Europe demand for crossover vehicles is likely to be considerable, Mr Panke said. \"There\\'s a growing market here,\" he said. \"We are going to go that way.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Wales hails new superstar\\n\\nOne game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.\\n\\nA mesmeric display against England, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club. At 23, Henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. And if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his Wales team-mates, then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the Valleys. The \"Red Dragonhood\" subdued the \"Red Rose Army\" in most areas of the field, but Henson\\'s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. He announced himself in the game\\'s opening salvo with a \"Welcome to Cardiff\" greeting for Mark Cueto on the gain line. And his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, Mathew Tait. The England centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson\\'s all-enveloping tackles.\\n\\nThe second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when England were starting to show menace. Showing awesome strength, Henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill. His kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain Gareth Thomas was in the sin-bin. One huge clearance from Tait\\'s kick sent England retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch. He also had a hand in the game\\'s only try, finished superbly by Williams, and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by Tait. Henson was twice repelled as Wales laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson\\'s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. But he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him. Replacement Gareth Cooper made the most of a poor Welsh scrum by chipping into space, where Jason Robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.\\n\\nFive metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick Stephen Jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence. \"It was out of Steve\\'s range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod,\" said Thomas. Henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero. Without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of English dominance and 12 years of waiting in Cardiff. \"I knew I was going to get it before I even took the kick,\" he said later, his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. \"I have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn\\'t a problem.\" There were still four minutes for Wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. But it was Wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax. \"Just Do It\" implored the front page headline on Saturday\\'s Western Mail newspaper. And, thanks to Henson, Wales did.\\n',\n",
       " 'Japan narrowly escapes recession\\n\\nJapan\\'s economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.\\n\\nRevised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.\\n\\nThe government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"I maintain the view that Japan\\'s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"It\\'s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.\\n',\n",
       " 'Worldcom ex-boss launches defence\\n\\nLawyers defending former WorldCom chief Bernie Ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.\\n\\nCynthia Cooper, WorldCom\\'s ex-head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the US telecoms giant in 2002. Her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (Â£5.7bn) accounting fraud. Mr Ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.\\n\\nProsecution lawyers have argued that Mr Ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at WorldCom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet Wall Street earnings estimates. But Ms Cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in New York on Wednesday that external auditors Arthur Andersen had approved WorldCom\\'s accounting in early 2001 and 2002. She said Andersen had given a \"green light\" to the procedures and practices used by WorldCom. Mr Ebber\\'s lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.\\n\\nMs Cooper also said that during shareholder meetings Mr Ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company\\'s finance chief, giving only \"brief\" answers himself. The prosecution\\'s star witness, former WorldCom financial chief Scott Sullivan, has said that Mr Ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to \"hit our books\". However, Ms Cooper said Mr Sullivan had not mentioned \"anything uncomfortable\" about WorldCom\\'s accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. Mr Ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI. Last week, MCI agreed to a buyout by Verizon Communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.\\n',\n",
       " 'The future in your pocket\\n\\nIf you are a geek or gadget fan, the next 12 months look like they are going to be a lot of fun.\\n\\nThe relentless pace of development in the hi-tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. To begin with, 2005 will be the year that third-generation (3G) mobile phones become inescapable. The 3 network launched in 2003, Vodafone launched its consumer service in November, Orange followed in early December and T-Mobile and O2 are due to launch in 2005. The main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up.\\n\\nAlready the extra capacity in 3G networks lets 3 offer good deals on voice calls at rates that will probably have to be matched by the other operators. But the shift in technology and low cost of voice calls means that operators lose a significant chunk of their revenue. \"Show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and I\\'ll write their obituary\" said Niel Ransom, chief technology officer at Alcatel.\\n\\nInstead operators are likely to push all other things that 3G phones can do such as video messaging and other multimedia capabilities. Already camera phones look set to challenge digital cameras and are likely to win more fans as multi-megapixel devices go on sale. But 3G will not have everything its own way. It will face competition from emerging technologies such as Wimax. This wireless technology can boost data transmission speeds up to 75 megabits per second and works over distances of up to 30 miles. Kent is likely to be the site of the UK\\'s first Wimax network which is due to go live in 2005 and it could be the way that rural areas get high-speed net access. Analyst firm Telecom View predicts that Wimax will steal a lot of market share from 3G and will be a clear winner. Bob Larribeau, principal analyst at Telecom View, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as Wimax could dent the possible returns of 3G networks. And the growing ubiquity of wi-fi must not be forgotten either. The technology is popping up in more places than ever and its wider use is only held back by the price differences across countries and suppliers.\\n\\nMoves to unite mobile and fixed phones look set to get more emphasis in 2005 too.\\n\\nFor a start, BT looks set to roll out its Bluephone project during the next 12 months. The service revolves around a hybrid device that uses the mobile networks when you are out and about but switches back to the fixed line when you are at home. Fixed line phones will also start to get much more serious competition from a technology that has the formidable name of Voice over IP (Voip). Voip routes calls via the net instead of the fixed line phone network. Anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the UK\\'s net using population, can use Voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. Telecommunications regulator Ofcom has declared 056 to be the area code for Voip calls and 2005 is likely to see a lot more consumer-focused Voip call services starting up. Home broadband services will also start to increase in speed as dwindling numbers of new users signing force the pace of competition. If 2004 has been the year of the portable music player, they 2005 looks like it will be the year of the portable media player. Motorola has just announced a deal with Apple to produce a phone that works with the iTunes service and other hybrid gadgets that sport a big memory and lots of other functions will become commonplace. The pace of advancement in storage media will continue mean that the cost per megabyte of memory will plummet. Some of those devices will sport huge hard drives letting you store more data than you ever wanted or knew you had. Convergence could mean that single-function devices start to dwindle in number. Instead every gadget will be able to do almost anything and communicate almost any way you want. The only downside is that consumers will face a series of tough choices as they are confronted by a bewildering array of gadgets each with an enormous numbers of features and vast data holding capacities. But that is the kind of problem most gadget fans can live with.\\n',\n",

The sequel follows the master criminals as they try to pull off three major heists across Europe. It knocked last week\\'s number one, National Treasure, into third place. Wesley Snipes\\' Blade: Trinity was in second, taking $16.1m (Â£8.4m). Rounding out the top five was animated fable The Polar Express, starring Tom Hanks, and festive comedy Christmas with the Kranks.\\n\\nOcean\\'s Twelve box office triumph marks the fourth-biggest opening for a December release in the US, after the three films in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The sequel narrowly beat its 2001 predecessor, Ocean\\'s Eleven which took $38.1m (Â£19.8m) on its opening weekend and $184m (Â£95.8m) in total. A remake of the 1960s film, starring Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack, Ocean\\'s Eleven was directed by Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh. Soderbergh returns to direct the hit sequel which reunites Clooney, Pitt and Roberts with Matt Damon, Andy Garcia and Elliott Gould. Catherine Zeta-Jones joins the all-star cast. \"It\\'s just a fun, good holiday movie,\" said Dan Fellman, president of distribution at Warner Bros. However, US critics were less complimentary about the $110m (Â£57.2m) project, with the Los Angeles Times labelling it a \"dispiriting vanity project\".

       " 'Gadgets galore on show at fair\\n\\nThe 2005 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is a geek\\'s paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.\\n\\nTop gadgets at the show are highlighted in the Innovations Showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. The BBC News website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. \\n\\n \\n\\nOne of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. The 2.5GB and 5GB circular pocket hard drive from Seagate might help. The external USB drive won a CES best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. \"It is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their PCs to look cool,\" said Seagate. \"It is all about style but it also has lots of functionality.\" \"It is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,\" it said. In the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. \\n\\n \\n\\nUniversal Electronics\\' NevoSL is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. It can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. Working with home broadband networks and PCs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. Paul Arling, UEI chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. He said the Nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. The Nevo won two awards at CES, one as a Girl\\'s Best Friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. The gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (Â£425). \\n\\n \\n\\nHotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its Solo Chassis gaming chair. The specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own \"space\". It is compatible with all the major games consoles, DVD players and PCs. \"We found that kids love playing in surround sound,\" said Jay LeBoff from Hotseat. \"We are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one.\" The chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. And a drinks holder. The chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in April and is expected to cost $399 (Â£211). \\n\\n \\n\\nSatellite radio is big business in the US. In the UK, the digital radio technology is known as DAB and works on slightly different technology. Eton Corporation\\'s Porsche designed P7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a DAB radio in the UK as well as a satellite radio set in the US. DAB sets have been slow to take-off in the UK, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. \"It is for the risqu&#233; consumer,\" said an Eton spokesperson. \"We are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer.\" The Porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of January in the US and in the first quarter of 2005 in the UK. In the US is it expected to cost $250 (Â£133). \\n\\n \\n\\nThe average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the Consumer Electronics Association, the organisation behind CES. This is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2GB - in five years\\' time. One gadget that might help swell that collection is Sanyo\\'s tiny handheld VPC-C4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. It combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. It takes MPEG4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. Images and video are stored on SD cards, which have come down in price in recent months. A 512MB card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. The device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. Because images and video are stored on SD memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. \\n\\n \\n\\nWearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. MPIO\\'s tiny digital USB music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the Apple iPod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. Slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck.

We will see how good France are and the scrum is the key. \"I just hope [the backs] carry on where they left off against Italy. It\\'s just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity.\" Wales have won two of their last three visits to Stade de France, having secured back-to-back wins under Graham Henry in 1999 and 2001. And with the likes of Shane Williams and Gavin Henson finding top form at the right time, Mike Ruddock\\'s team is now one of international rugby\\'s most potent attacking threats. \"Gavin is ridiculously talented. He has been bouncing around the place this week, so he is up for it,\" warned Jones.\\n\\nFrance have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over Scotland and France. Captain Fabien Pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair, but stressed the game with be won or lost up front. The lock believes the Welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out, but Jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear.\\n\\n\"Gethin [Jenkins] won\\'t be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will,\" said Jones, who will be facing France for the first time. \"We will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs. \"Me and Gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of Mefin\\'s experience in there. \"Mefin is a good thinker who puts things across. But what is the saying? If you are good enough you are old enough and Gethin certainly is. \"He is a really good player and I imagine he will be on the Lions tour [to New Zealand this summer].\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Parry firm over Gerrard\\n\\nListen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.\\n\\nBut Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told BBC Five Live: \"Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. \"It doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s Â£30m, Â£40m or Â£50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can\\'t keep Steven against his will.\" On the subject of Liverpool\\'s finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.\\n\\nAnd responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.\\n\\nOn the subject of Liverpool\\'s captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid\\n\\ndid\\n\\nask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: \"They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale.\" But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: \"I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa\\'s views. \"We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he\\'s ambitious and nobody can argue with that.\\n\\n\"I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he\\'d like to do anything else. \"We all want to see progress by next season. He\\'s not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.\" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. \"There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn\\'t had an offer last summer,\" Parry explained. \"We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn\\'t want to sell him. In reality it didn\\'t go beyond that. \"Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won\\'t.\\n\\n\"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. \"You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn\\'t work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him \\'by the way we\\'ve decided to sell you\\' is not on the agenda. You can forget that.\" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool\\'s new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal\\'s Â£100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: \"I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.\\n\\n\"I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn\\'t even been worth contemplating. \"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say \\'wow - that\\'s interesting.\\' \"My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.\" Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: \"I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. \"If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. \"I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. \"That\\'s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore.\"\\n\\nOn the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as \"a stalking horse\" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: \"Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There\\'s no need, and that is not the way we do business. \"We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn\\'t happen. \"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. \"Steve\\'s interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? \"The door isn\\'t closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. \"We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That\\'s a dream we all share, so as far as I\\'m concerned the door is not closed.\"\\n\\nI would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\\n\\nÂ£50m for Gerrard? I don\\'t care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard\\'s quality.\\n\\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\\n\\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn\\'t walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\\n\\nÂ£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard\\'s transfer for any fee over Â£35m.\\n\\nParry\\'s statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\\n\\nI would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.\\n\\nThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn\\'t, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.\\n',\n",
       " 'Police chief backs drinking move\\n\\nA chief constable has backed the introduction of 24-drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.\\n\\nHowever, Norfolk police chief Andy Hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed. \"I don\\'t subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it,\" he said. His comments come after the Liberal Democrats backed Tory demands that the government\\'s plans be put on hold. Andy Hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 February. \"I feel that is a premature position to be taking,\" he said. Among those who have criticised the plans are the UK\\'s top policeman Sir John Stevens.\\n\\nThe Metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24-hour drinking should be re-examined because of a binge drinking \"epidemic\". However, Mr Hayman said: \"It would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, \\'I\\'m very sorry\\'. He said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation. \"My view is that I have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen, \" he said. However, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24-hour drinking. But he is confident problems in the early days can be \"ironed out\". He believed the majority of people favoured this law change and \"we have to accept that lifestyles are changing\". But aspects such as transport, and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account.\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair has defended the Licensing Act, saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in Europe because of a \"tiny minority\" of violent binge drinkers. A six-month transitional period starts on 7 February during which time venues can apply for extended licences. The Conservatives have called for 24-hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved. On Monday, the Lib Dems also called for a delay. Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"It would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours.\" Chief constable Mr Hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems. \"If you come to Norwich on a Friday or Saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed. \"However, I want industry to succeed in Norwich and I want Norwich to be the recognised nightspot of East Anglia. \"There is no way I want to say we cannot manage it or police it.

       " '\\'Brainwave\\' cap controls computer\\n\\nA team of US researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.\\n\\nFour people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. The New York team reported their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"The results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,\" said Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane. The research team, from New York State Department of Health and State University of New York in Albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.\\n\\nThe four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.\\n\\nBrain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. Complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. Such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. \"The impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,\" said the researchers. The four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. Although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. It is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. Some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. Earlier this year, a team at the MIT Media Labs Europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.\\n',\n",

Fellow guest Ruth Kelly MP was also hit by the slurry. Mr Kilroy-Silk said the man, who later disappeared, claimed he was \"doing it in the name of Islam\". In January, Mr Kilroy-Silk quit his BBC One show for remarks he made about Arabs, who he called \"suicide bombers\".\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk had already been taken off air by BBC bosses for the comments, in which he also described Arabs as \"limb-amputators, women repressors\". The remarks prompted outrage among Muslim groups. The slurry attack took place on Friday as Mr Kilroy-Silk and Ms Kelly, a Cabinet Office minister and Bolton West MP, arrived at Manchester High School for Girls for the recording of BBC Radio 4\\'s Any Questions.\\n\\nThe police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. They are treating the incident as assault. The programme\\'s host, Jonathan Dimbleby, later told the audience the MEP had been covered from \"head to toe\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.\\n\\nHe told reporters he was \"very angry\" and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. He said the man shouted: \"You\\'ve offended my religion, I\\'m doing this in the name of Islam.\" \"As I started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car,\" Mr Kilroy-Silk said. \"I was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. It went all inside the car and splattered Ruth Kelly.\" A BBC spokesman said: \"He took his seat as Jonathan Dimbleby was introducing the show. Fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have.\" Greater Manchester Police said people near Mr Kilroy-Silk had also been hit by the waste. Officers took statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made. Police say the suspect ran off after towards Wilmslow Road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red Vauxhall Corsa earlier. The suspect is described as white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard. Police want to hear from anyone who has any information.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk, an MEP for the East Midlands, resigned the UK Independence Party whip in the European Parliament in October, after criticising UKIP and stating his ambition to be leader. However, he remains a member of the party. He said on Friday he hoped to be elected party leader before Christmas. \"I think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the General Election.\" But a UKIP spokesman said that would be impossible under the party\\'s constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.\\n',\n",

Davies, one of the stars of Saturday\\'s RBS Six Nations win over England, is only on a year contract at Kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the Celtic Warriors region left Davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with Neath RFC. Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the Wales management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated. \"The WRU didn\\'t give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing,\" Davies said at the time. \"It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career.\"\\n',\n",

I am always confident and we must be positive.\"\\n\\nBenitez defended goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, whose failure to hold on to Dimitar Berbatov\\'s weak drive allowed Franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the German team a lifeline for the second leg. \"For me it was not Jerzy Dudek\\'s fault,\" added Benitez. \"He had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal. It would not have mattered. \"If we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. \"In my opinion Jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and I am happy with him. \"If we lose 2-0 we are out but I think we can score in Germany - certainly one, and that will make all the difference.\" And the Liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper Steven Gerrard, who was suspended for the Anfield leg, back for the return in Germany.\\n\\n\"Steven Gerrard is a key player for us,\" said Benitez. \"When he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others. \"Steven is one of the best players in the world, but I need a team that is not about just one player.

However, rival suitor Euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. Ahead of talks with the LSE on Friday, the pan-European bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. The Paris-based exchange, owner of Liffe in London, is reported to be ready to raise Â£1.4bn to fund a bid.\\n\\nThe news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. However, the LSE did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of LSE\\'s shareholders and customers. In the meantime, Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the LSE. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. However, neither side has made a formal offer for the LSE, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.\\n\\nDeutsche Boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. Among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by Mr Seifert with Ms Furse were plans to move the management of its cash and Eurex derivatives market to London, as well as two members of its executive board. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany\\'s central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. \"It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. Local government officials in Frankfurt\\'s state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"It is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain Frankfurt\\'s standing as the number one financial centre in continental Europe,\" Alois Rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.\\n',\n",
       " 'Correction agency plans dropped\\n\\nPlans to create a single correctional agency for Scotland have been scrapped.\\n\\nThe Scottish Executive will not now merge the Scottish Prison Service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. The National Correctional Agency would have provided a \\'one-stop\\' justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition. Instead, Scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. The plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.\\n\\nScotland\\'s reoffending rate is high, with more than 60% of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail. This is leading to an ever-expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem. Ministers thought merging the prison service with the council-controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer. However, following a consultation on the idea, Justice Minister Cathy Jamieson has decided to drop the plans. Instead, Ms Jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system.\\n\\nShe will announce the move in her Criminal Justice Plan on Monday, aiming to \"break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community\". The new measures will place a new statutory duty on the SPS to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships. A national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise Ms Jamieson on the SPS\\'s role and performance in reducing reoffending. The minister said: \"Better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. \"Communities who are paying the price for this reoffending - both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs - expect better. \"It costs the taxpayer Â£35,000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing. \"Taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison. \"Therefore, as we continue to invest in the service, it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves, to ministers and to parliament.\"\\n',\n",

The survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have MP3 players. The American love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.\\n\\nOf the 22 million Americans who own MP3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. Those on high income - judged to be $75,000 (Â£39,000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30, 000 ( Â£15,000). Broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. Almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. MP3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. Almost one in five US citizens aged under 30 have one. This compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48.

       " 'Call centre users \\'lose patience\\'\\n\\nCustomers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.\\n\\nOnce past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"Customers are getting used to the idea of an \\'always available\\' society,\" says Cara Diemont of IT firm Dimension Data, which commissioned the survey. However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. One possible reason for the lack in patience, Ms Diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling \\'on the move\\' using their mobile phones.\\n\\nThe surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres\\' growing range of tasks. \"Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" Ms Diemont says. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.\\n\\nIn what Dimension Data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". This, Ms Diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. Poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. As a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. Resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer\\'s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. When the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.\\n\\nSuggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.\\n\\nThere are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world. \"You can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. However, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. Half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. But not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. They give three key reasons for not making the move:\\n\\n- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", \\n - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, \\n - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of Dimension Data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. What are your experiences with call centres? Are you happy to listen to Vivaldi or Greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? And if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\\n',\n",

       " 'Savvy searchers fail to spot ads\\n\\nInternet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits.\\n\\nThe report by the US Pew Research Center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. It also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. The report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use Google, Ask Jeeves, MSN and Yahoo when online.\\n\\nAlmost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. According to figures gathered by the Pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. A significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. For 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.\\n\\nSearch engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. According to Pew Research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. Despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. A small number, 17%, said they wouldn\\'t really miss search engines if they did not exist. The remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. More than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. Alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. Of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. Only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. Said the Pew report: \"This finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results.\" Commenting Mr Macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.\\n',\n",

Victory would have given Spain the title but they were outclassed. In Sunday\\'s reverse singles, Carlos Moya takes on Andy Roddick before Rafael Nadal faces Mardy Fish. \"It feels good, but it\\'s not going to be as good if we don\\'t win two tomorrow,\" said Mike Bryan. \"It feels good to give those guys another shot, and Spain has to go to sleep on that.\" Bob Bryan added: \"I\\'m really confident in Andy winning that first match, and then anything can happen.\" Spain coach Jordi Arrese chose to rest 18-year-old Nadal in the doubles after his epic singles win over Roddick on Friday. He was replaced by former world number one Ferrero, but the Spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world\\'s best doubles teams.\\n\\nThe 26-year-old Bryan twins have won all four of their Davis Cup matches this year. And they quickly silenced the huge crowd at the Olympic Stadium, racing through the opening set to love. The Spaniards then twice surrendered breaks of serve at the start of the second before the Bryans broke to go 5-3 ahead and served out. When Robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable Bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win. Ferrero, who was upset to be dropped for Friday\\'s singles, hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. \"It was a difficult game against the best doubles players,\" he said. \"They have everything calculated and we had very little to do. \"I was a bit surprised that I was named to play the doubles match because I hardly play doubles.\" Arrese said: \"Juan Carlos hasn\\'t played at all badly.

       " 'SA unveils \\'more for all\\' budget\\n\\nThe South African government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.\\n\\nAiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country\\'s poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was \"more for all\". The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; Â£910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.\\n\\nUnveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.\\n\\nHe predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.\\n\\n\"In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,\" said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a \"marked improvement\" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. \"It\\'s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it\\'s a good incentive for business,\" he said.\\n',\n",

However, the trial was suspended when Mr Botin\\'s lawyer introduced a new set of documents on the day testimony was set to begin. A three-judge panel gave prosecution lawyers until Monday to study the documents, when the trial will be reconvened.\\n\\nThe high-profile case began after two Santander shareholders filed a criminal complaint about the payments to Jose Maria Amusategui and Angel Corcostegui, who stepped down in 2001. Both executives helped Mr Botin orchestrate Spain\\'s biggest bank merger, between Santander and Banco Central Hispano, in 1999. As he arrived at Spain\\'s High Court earlier on Wednesday, Mr Botin greeted the waiting media, saying: \"I have full faith in justice.\" Santander\\'s board of governors strongly reject the charges against their chairman, saying the payouts were legal and made with their unanimous support. But if convicted, Mr Botin could face a prison term of up to six years. Mr Corcostegui, a former CEO at Santander, also asked the court for new evidence to be admitted. In spite of the allegations against him, Mr Botin continues to lead Santander, and was instrumental in the Â£8.5bn takeover last November of the British bank Abbey National. Since taking over the chairmanship in 1986, he has turned Santander into one of the top ten biggest banks in the world.\\n',\n",

At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states. \"Of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines?\" said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary general of the Association of European Airlines. \"Our industry is in the midst of a fundamental crisis...only to be once again confronted with a measure designed to increase our costs,\" he continued.\\n\\nThe EU sought to allay the airlines\\' fears, stressing that Thursday\\'s meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. It added that any plan to levy taxes on jet fuel \"should not hinder the competitiveness of the airlines and that they themselves will not be solely funding development\". Any tax would only be implemented after full consultation with the airlines, the EU said. There is thought to be widespread support for the plan - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting of the world\\'s richest nations - from EU ministers. The issue of poverty in Africa and South Asia has forced itself to the top of the politicial agenda, with politicians and campaigners calling for more to be done.

But he experienced hostility from unionists some of whom dubbed him \"Minister of Discord\". After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister. Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996.

       " \"What the election should really be about?\\n\\nA general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. Here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected Spring poll.\\n\\nWe've called for the state pension to be increased from Â£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of Â£105.45. That's what we're calling for. Many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.\\n\\nWe've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. This will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. Once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. It's our way of putting the politicians on notice. We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. Before 1997 most pensioners voted Conservative. In 1997 and 2001 they voted Labour. But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around. They cannot take that vote for granted.\\n\\nPensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue. He said the UK had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.\\n\\nThat the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.\\n\\nWe haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs. Various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. We don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.\\n\\nIt is hard to say whether we will be successful. We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.\\n\\nRepealing the Hunting Bill.\\n\\nWe are challenging the use of the Parliament Act 1949 in a High Court action. We are hoping to hear in the New Year. Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. When the ban comes into force on 18 February we will be going to the European Court because no compensation is being paid. So there's a lot of legal territory to go. We are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. Whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (Rural affairs minister) Alun Michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. It is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. Of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.\\n\\nIt will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election Tony Blair will ever face. It's exactly what the prime minister did not want. He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.\\n\\nPeople using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. It is another sort of form of shooting for sport. The principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant.\\n\\nWe will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK. We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors. With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.\\n\\nI think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure. But it will mobilise public opinion. Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.\\n\\nThe issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. Choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.\\n\\nFirstly, we have our website. It features our campaigns and changes every day. Secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. Thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. We will invite the opinion formers, MPs, journalists and others. The idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.\\n\\nI think we will be successful. It's very much the language being used by the main political parties. Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.\\n\\nFuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. We have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that Gordon Brown has been postponing and postponing. Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about Â£750. If you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that.\\n\\nIf fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. There will be a huge effect throughout the industry and I would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. What it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.\\n\\nWe will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.\\n\",\n",

But fans around the world have pitched in to pay for the advert, which had the headline \"Save Star Trek\". They are also asking the Sci-Fi Channel to pick it up from UPN and will stage a rally in Los Angeles on 25 February.\\n\\nThe advert described the Star Trek franchise as a \"cultural icon\". Enterprise stars former Quantum Leap actor Scott Bakula as Captain Archer and is set before the original 1960s Star Trek series. \"Captain Archer and the crew of the NX-01 need your help to continue their journeys!\" the advert said. It also included a cut-out coupon for fans to send to UPN\\'s parent companies Paramount and Viacom plus the Sci-Fi Channel. It also urged supporters to join the rally outside the Paramount studios.\\n\\nFan website Trek United is hoping to raise $32m (Â£17m) from donations by the end of March to pay for a fifth series. More than $23,000 (Â£12,000) has been pledged so far, according to the site. The 98th and final episode of Star Trek: Enterprise will air in the US on 13 May. The fourth series has averaged 2.9 million viewers per episode - half the amount it got in its first series. Star Trek: Enterprise began in 2001 following other Star Trek spin-off series The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Voyager.\\n',\n",

       " 'Yukos accused of lying to court\\n\\nRussian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.\\n\\nThe unit, Yugansk, was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) back tax bill. Yukos argued that since it had a US subsidiary and local bank accounts, the US court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of Yugansk. But Deutsche Bank - itself a target of a Yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank\\'s evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in Houston. Its lawyer, Hugh Ray, told the court that Yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two Texas bank accounts opened by its new US subsidiary. By doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its US presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in US courts. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated.\\n\\nYukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point. He said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 December. Even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.\\n\\nDeutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm Gazprom the money to bid for Yuganskneftegaz, as the Yukos unit is formally known. The sale went ahead, despite an order from the US bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. In the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm Rosneft. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s very profitable oil business back under state control.\\n\\nYukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia. It also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"It gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Yukos is currently suing four companies - Gazprom, its unit Gazpromneft, Rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in Yugansk\\'s disposal. It has also threatened to sue the Russian government for $28bn. Analysts have questioned whether a US court has any jurisdiction over Russian companies, while Moscow officials have dismissed Yukos\\' legal wrangling as meaningless. Yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, once Russia\\'s richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\\n',\n",
       " 'Court halts Mark Morrison album\\n\\nPremiership footballer and record company boss Kevin Campbell has gained a court injunction stopping R&B singer Mark Morrison from releasing an album.\\n\\nThe Everton striker signed Morrison to his fledging 2 Wikid Records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album Innocent Man. Now he is attempting to prevent Morrison releasing the album on Monday through another label. But Morrison vowed to ignore the order, saying \"no judge is gonna stop me\".\\n\\nMorrison, who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career, rose to fame with the 1996 single Return of the Mack.\\n\\nBut the Leicester singer has struggled to repeat its success following two spells in jail. One was for hiring a stand-in to complete his community service for possession of a stun gun and three-months following a nightclub fracas. He signed to Mr Campbell\\'s label a year ago and has released one single, with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 January. But Mr Campbell said he learned that Morrison planned to release the album through Jet Star, which is advertising it on its website. Mr Campbell said: \"I\\'m glad we were granted the injunction but I\\'m completely gutted that we have had to go that far. \"Mark Morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 Wikid but it seems that he couldn\\'t help but return to his old ways.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve worked hard to realise my ambition in football but had hoped that my future career would be in the music business. \"I have always dreamt of starting a record label but now Mark Morrison has spoilt that dream for me. There is no loyalty in this business - just greed.\"\\n\\nBut Morrison is determined the album will be released on Monday. He said: \"The injunction is ludicrous. \"I signed a new deal with a new record company because I was not getting the support I needed from 2 Wikid. \"I was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record, which was not properly promoted. He added: \"The whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on December 27. No injunction or judge will stop it. The Mack will return.\" The case is set to be heard in the High Court on 20 December.\\n',\n",
       " 'Celts savour Grand Slam prospect\\n\\nThe Six Nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and Wales and Ireland rather than traditional big guns France and England face a potential Grand Slam play-off in three weeks\\' time.\\n\\nBut before that game in Cardiff, Wales must get past Scotland at Murrayfield, while Ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial French. No-one knows what mood France will be in at Lansdowne Road on 12 March - sublime, as in the first half against Wales, or ridiculous, like in the same period against England at Twickenham. But how the mighty have fallen. England sat on rugby\\'s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 Grand Slam winners. But they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in Sydney. And they face the ignominy of what could amount to a Wooden Spoon play-off against Italy in a fortnight.\\n\\nEngland are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain Richard Hill was dumped in favour of Mike Harrison after three straight losses in 1987. Coach Andy Robinson, who took over from the successful Sir Clive Woodward in September, has lost a phalanx of World Cup stars. And he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team. The same year that England ruled the roost, a woeful Wales lost all five matches in the Six Nations. And they won only two games, against Scotland and Italy, in 2004. Wales\\' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last Grand Slam success came in 1978 in the era of Gareth Edwards, Phil Bennett, JPR Williams et al.\\n\\nBut Welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age. After several false dawns, coach Mike Ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations. The fresh verve is inspired by skipper Gareth Thomas, now out with a broken thumb, accurate kicking from either fly-half Stephen Jones or centre Gavin Henson, a rampant Martyn Williams leading the way up front, and exciting runners in the guise of Henson and Shane Williams. Ireland coach Eddie O\\'Sullivan and captain Brian O\\'Driscoll have got their side buzzing too, and they are close to shedding the \"nearly-men\" tag that has dogged them for the past few years. The men from the Emerald Isle have been Six Nations runners-up for the past two years, to France and England.\\n\\nBut they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a Grand Slam in 1948. As for Scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 Wooden Spoon \"winners\" have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. Italy continue the elusive search for their first Six Nations away win, and can still only account for the scalps of Scotland (twice) and Wales since joining the elite in 2000. Coach John Kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the Azzurri, but is lacking in raw materials. And so to France. Brilliant one minute, inept the next. But the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in Dublin and end up winning the title through the back door. Ireland, though, have won three times in their last five meetings. Welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the Celtic showdown to crown their Grand Slam. But given that Ireland have beaten Wales in four of their last five meetings, the Welsh legions are likely to be behind Les Bleus on 12 March.\\n',\n",
       " \"Wales win in Rome\\n\\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\\n\\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\\n\\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\\n\\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\\n\\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\\n\\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\\n\\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\\n\\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\\n\\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\\n\\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\\n\",\n",

The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy\\'s foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game.

Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze\\'s head.\\n\\nThe striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal\\'s overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side\\'s behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked.

       " \"Cabs collect mountain of mobiles\\n\\nGadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. But that just means we are more likely to lose them.\\n\\nIn London alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. That works out at about three phones per cab. Over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs such as Palms and Pocket PCs were left in licensed cabs. Even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. Jemima Khan reportedly left her iPod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be Hugh Grant. As the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. The numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.\\n\\nThis has left Londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. More than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in London as in any of the nine other cities (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago and Sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. By contrast Danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in Germans, Norwegians and Swedes. Top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. Given that few people back up the data on their PC it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. You could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.\\n\\nEqually, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. This growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as Retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. Briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the Mobile Equipment National Database that lets you register the unique ID number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. According to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. Millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as Transport For London regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. For the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. The survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Budget to set scene for election\\n\\nGordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour\\'s bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour.\\n\\nTreasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about Â£2bn to spare.\\n\\n- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from Â£60,000 \\n - A freeze on petrol duty \\n - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families \\n - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties\\' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than Â£60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government\\'s tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to Â£150,000 in February.\\n\\nThe Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: \"Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,\" he said. \"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around Â£10bn.\"\\n\\nBut Mr Brown\\'s former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a Â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: \"I don\\'t accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.\"\\n\\nFor the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said. \"But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way.\" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a Â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing.

       " 'Long life promised for laptop PCs\\n\\nScientists are working on ways to ensure laptops can stay powered for an entire working day.\\n\\nBuilding batteries from new chemical mixes could boost power significantly, say industry experts. The changes include everything from the way chips for laptops are made, to tricks that reduce the power consumption of displays. Ever since laptops appeared the amount of time they last between recharges has been a frustration for users.\\n\\nA survey carried out in 2000 by Forrester Research found that the shortness of battery life was the most complained about feature of laptops. \"The focus back then was more on performance and features,\" said Mike Trainor, chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant Intel.\\n\\n\"For most of the 90s battery life was stuck on two to 2.5 hours.\" But now, he said, laptops can last much longer. It was not just a case of improving battery life by squeezing more out of the lithium ion power packs, he explained. Other changes are needed to get to the holy grail of a laptop running for about eight hours before needing a recharge. \"Lithium ion is never going to get there by itself,\" he said. \"The industry has done a great job of wringing all possible energy storage out of that technology that they can.\" Some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space, said Mr Trainor, though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing. He was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs. \"In fuel cells you need to have pumps and separators and evaporation chambers,\" he said. \"It\\'s a mini energy plant that needs to be shrunk and shrunk and shrunk.\"\\n\\nIntel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry.\\n\\nThis work has led to the creation of the Mobile PC Extended Battery Life (EBL) Working Group that shares information about building notebooks that are more parsimonious with power. Some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking, said Mr Trainor. Intel has also changed the way it creates transistors on silicon to reduce the power they need. On a larger scale, said Mr Trainor, improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient. Also, said Mr Trainor, research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays - currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop. Many laptop makers have committed to creating 14 and 15 inch screens that draw only three watts of power. This is far below the power consumption levels of screens in current notebooks. \"If we can get close to eight hours that\\'s a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that\\'s what the industry has to deliver,\" Mr Trainor said.\\n',\n",

Neil Mellor gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from Milan Baros' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had Lee Bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back Luis Garcia after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after Craig Bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And Garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from Baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards.

And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when Baros slid a perfect pass into Mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into Given's bottom corner. Garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at Given after good work by Xabi Alonso. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by Harry Kewell set Baros free and he rounded Given to score. Jermaine Jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross.

Federer, who lost in the quarter-final in his last Qatar appearance in 2003, was happy with his form. \"I think I played better than against Greg Rusedski and I am happy I am playing so well,\" said the top seed.

       " 'Blunkett row should end - Blair\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.\\n\\nThe Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett\\'s ex-lover\\'s nanny. Sir Alan Budd found a \"chain of events\" linked Mr Blunkett to Leoncia Casalme\\'s indefinite leave to remain application. At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.\\n\\nOn Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn\\'s nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett\\'s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover\\'s nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. In his first comments since Sir Alan\\'s announcement, Mr Blair told BBC News he had not yet read the report in detail. But told BBC News: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, we have drawn a line under that.\"\\n\\nAsked if Mr Blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point, he replied: \"I have made my admiration for David very clear and it remains. \"He\\'s been a tremendous colleague, he\\'s done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. The future is something we will have to approach in the future.\" The prime minister shrugged off claims from Conservative leader Michael Howard that he led a \"grubby government\". He said Mr Blunkett\\'s integrity remained intact: \"He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up. He accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened, he said. \"But I think Sir Alan Budd also accepted there wasn\\'t some conspiracy or cover-up and I just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on.\"\\n\\nEarlier, Mr Howard said: \"There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry. There were so many questions that weren\\'t answered.\" There was \"deceit at the heart of government\" which was not limited to the visa affair, he argued. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was \"a strong case for a judge-led judicial review\".\\n\\nHe said: \"Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that.\" Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan\\'s findings. In a statement, the ex-home secretary said he accepted the inquiry\\'s findings. He said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system.\\n',\n",

Metrovias, the private firm which runs the five tube lines in the city, has offered an 8% increase in wages. The firm promised no jobs would be lost as a result of new ticket machines. It said it would put this commitment on paper.\\n\\nUnderground staff have warned they will continue with the protests until the management put an acceptable offer on the table. The Argentine Work Ministry has been mediating in the conflict and it could call an \"obligatory conciliation\", which would force both sides to find a solution and put an end to the conflict.

       " 'Vera Drake\\'s Bafta triumph hope\\n\\nAt the Bafta film awards on Saturday night, there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.\\n\\nVera Drake, Mike Leigh\\'s tale about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, is nominated in 11 categories. These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics\\' Circle on Wednesday night.\\n\\nThe Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine\\'s reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\\n\\n\"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\\n\\n\"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.\"\\n\\n\"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year\\'s Baftas\", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Guardian\\'s film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can\\'t do so, what hope is there?\" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh\\'s \"masterpiece\" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man\\'s Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy. \"I will be cheering if Vera Drake wins a whole host of awards,\" he added.\\n',\n",
       " 'SEC to rethink post-Enron rules\\n\\nThe US stock market watchdog\\'s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.\\n\\nIn a speech at the London School of Economics, William Donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\\n\\nThe Act comes into force in mid-2005. It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.\\n\\nFirms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". There are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the Act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. The Act also applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.\\n\\nThe 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.\\n\\n\"We should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the US market into \"one with no exit\", he said. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act\\'s least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. Seen as particularly costly to implement, Section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm\\'s internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (Â£374m).\\n\\nA delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.\\n\\nIt was led by Digby Jones, director general of the UK\\'s Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and included representatives of BASF, Siemens and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month. There are also rumours that two Chinese state-run banks - China Construction Bank and Bank of China - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in New York later this year. Instead, the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in Hong Kong, according to press reports in China.\\n',\n",
       " 'Strike threat over pension plans\\n\\nMillions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.\\n\\nThe Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. They believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.\\n\\nIt is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a \"career average\" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. \"Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. \"Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. \"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.\" On Monday, Tony Blair\\'s official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: \"What\\'s important is that there\\'s a process going on, it\\'s out for consultation at the moment, let\\'s wait for that process to complete itself.\"\\n\\nThere is already widespread anger over the chancellor\\'s plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. \"Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,\" he said. \"What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can\\'t afford it for anyone else. \"This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next.\"\\n\\nMr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: \"The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.\"\\n',\n",

She says she will fight on her record \"as a hard-working constituency MP\". Mr Kilroy-Silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, Veritas, the Latin for truth. The East Midlands MEP, who quit the UK Independence Party, wants his new group to \"change the face\" of UK politics. His choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. UKIP won 31% of the vote in Erewash in last June\\'s European elections - with Mr Kilroy-Silk among their candidates for the region. Until 1997, Erewash had been held by the Tories since 1970. Ms Blackman said she was proud of the government\\'s achievements in the area. She declined to give her view of Mr Kilroy-Silk at this point.\\n\\nOn Thursday, he told a London news conference that Veritas would avoid the old parties\\' \"lies and spin\". He said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration and promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration. Veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.\\n\\nUKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". Mr Kilroy-Silk was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP\\'s two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney, who is now Veritas\\' deputy leader.\\n\\nUKIP\\'s chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June\\'s European elections. UKIP\\'s leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now \\'goodbye\\',\" he said.

       " 'Format wars could \\'confuse users\\'\\n\\nTechnology firms Sony, Philips, Matsushita and Samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.\\n\\nThe firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. The move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. They say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.\\n\\nCurrently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. Systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as Digital Rights Management systems. By setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. In a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\". The firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. Called the Marlin Joint Development Association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. Marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm Intertrust as well as an earlier DRM system developed by a group known as the Coral Consortium.\\n\\nThe move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by Apple and Microsoft. Confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as Microsoft and Apple. \"In many ways the different DRM systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as Betamax and VHS, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said Ian Fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at Jupiter Research. \"The difference is that it is very fragmented,\" he said. \"It\\'s not a two-horse race, it\\'s a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race\" Mr Fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. He said currently there were even incompatibilities within DRM families. Although initiatives such as Microsoft\\'s \"Plays for Sure\" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.\\n\\nShelley Taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. Apple\\'s iTunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. \"Although iTunes has been hugely successful, Apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those iPods,\" she said.\\n\\nShe said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. \"It always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,\" she said, \"and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest.\" Ms Taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. \"People want portability,\" she said, \"and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability.\" Cory Doctorow, European co-ordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the Marlin system would achieve its aims. \"Not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said. He said many firms readily admit that their DRM systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. Instead, said Mr Doctorow, DRM systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. \"The studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the iPod version, the auto version, the American and UK version, the ringtone version, and so on.\"\\n',\n",

He, like Mr Kennedy, pointed to the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrated against plans for the Iraq war.\\n\\nMr Cook, who is giving evidence to the Power inquiry into voter turnout rates, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today Programme it was not fair to blame the public who were \"more interested in politics than ever before\". \"They are turned off by the way we do politics in Britain. There\\'s a message there for politicians.\" He urged politicians to avoid negative campaigning and to \"speak more from the heart\". \"We should be not so afraid to say what we stand for.\" He also criticised the cult of personality politics: \"There\\'s far too much interest in celebrities. \"Politics are in danger of becoming another branch of the celebrity industry.\" The government has tried a number of things in an attempt to boost voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.

Mido said: \"There isn\\'t much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes.\" Mido was axed by former coach Marco Tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury. But he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September. Mido added: \"It\\'s not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national\\'s team\\'s matches as my top priority. \"I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success. \"I do confess that I was rude to the Egyptian press at times but now I have gained more experience and know that I will never go anywhere without the press\\'s support. \"Many of the international stars like David Beckham and (Zinedine) Zidane had the press opposing them. \"So I\\'m now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and I don\\'t have to overreact when this happens.

However, Judge Letitia Clark said the hearing would continue on Thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. Russian authorities are due to auction off Yuganskneftegas on 19 December to pay a huge tax bill sent to Yukos.\\n\\nRussian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm\\'s most lucrative asset Yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (Â£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by Yukos.\\n\\nFiling for bankruptcy protection in the US was \"a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,\" said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. The company added it had opted to take action through American courts as US bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company\\'s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders\\' investments. However, as the firm is based in Russia and has no significant US assets, lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case. \"We are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on Sunday,\" Zack Clement, a lawyer for Yukos, told Judge Clark in an emergency hearing in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday. As well as the bid to get Chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors, allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the Russian government. Yukos asked the Houston court to order Russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a \"campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate\" tax claims. Mr Clement said that under Russian law, the Russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.\\n\\nHe added that the opening bid for the firm\\'s Yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that Yukos advisers say it is worth. \"We believe the only significant bidder at the auction on Sunday is Gazprom,\" he said, referring to Russia\\'s natural gas giant. Yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and \"will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm.\" Many commentators believe the Russian government\\'s aggressive pursuit of Yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky, who had funded liberal opposition groups, was arrested in October last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail Analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off, it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm, like Gazprom, effectively bringing a large chunk of Russia\\'s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.\\n',\n",

But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters\\' faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election. And there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week\\'s Budget. The aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core Labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle England voters who gave Tony Blair two election victories don\\'t desert him at the third poll.\\n\\nAnd, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown\\'s own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. But there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of Â£11 billion or thereabouts. That is the size of the financial \"black hole\" the Tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.\\n\\nThe opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. It was immediately denied, but the Tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as Mr Letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from.\\n\\nMr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win. Previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can Britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending. The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. And there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in Whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. And it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.\\n',\n",
       " 'Row brewing over peer-to-peer ads\\n\\nMusic download networks are proving popular not just with an audience of youngsters keen to take advantage of free music but with advertisers equally keen to reach out to a captive audience.\\n\\nThe debate over the legitimacy of file-sharing networks rages on as the music industry continues its threats to close the services down for good. Meanwhile the millions of downloaders are proving both an advertiser\\'s dream come true and a branding nightmare. Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit - a peer to peer service which provides paid-for music downloads - believes it is time advertisers stopped providing \\'oxygen\\' for companies that support illegal downloading. \"You may be surprised to know that current advertisers on the most popular peer to peer service eDonkey who now steadfastly support copyright theft with real cash money include Nat West, Vodafone, O2, First Direct, NTL, and Renault,\" he said in an open letter to the British Phonographic Industry last month.\\n\\nHe urged people to follow his lead and \\'dump\\' brands associated with companies such as eDonkey. The BPI is equally quick to condemn established brands becoming bedfellows with peer to peer networks. \\'Networks like eDonkey, Kazaa and Grokster facilitate illegal filesharing. The BPI strongly believes that any reputable company should look carefully at the support they are giving these networks through their advertising revenue,\" it said in a statement. \"Illegal file-sharers steal millions of pounds worth of music through these services. We are sure that the companies advertising on them would not put up with theft on such a scale from their own businesses,\" it said. But the issue is often more complicated for advertisers, said Mark Mulligan, a music analyst with Jupiter Research. \"This has been a problem for a long time, ever since the days of Napster,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nThe reality is that the millions of downloaders represent a very attractive audience. \"Advertisers probably pay a lot less for putting ads here than on more respected sites and they are reaching the perfect target audience,\" he said. \"If you put the legality issues aside, not to advertise here would mean missing out on a valuable audience,\" he added. Meanwhile companies contacted by the BBC News website insist that they were not directly aware of where their ads have been appearing. OneTel adverts were spotted on eDonkey this week and its response was typical. \"We have investigated this matter and believe that one of our affiliate partners has placed this advert without our knowledge. It is not our policy to advertise through peer-to-peer networks,\" read a statement from the discount phone firm. It has requested the advert be removed immediately, said a spokeswoman. Similarly telecommunications firm NTL blames its media buying agency which places adverts with third party networks featuring thousands of sites. Since the matter was brought to its attention last month, the agency has strict instructions to make sure ads do not appear on such sites, a spokesman told the BBC News website.\\n\\nHowever Mr Mulligan was not entirely convinced by these explanations. While smaller brands might not necessarily be aware of where the money they allocate to online advertising actually ends, this is no excuse for well-known brands, he said. \"I would be surprised if these brands didn\\'t have the know-how to prevent this happening,\" he said. At the moment eDonkey is enjoying the benefits of having some very well-known faces advert on its network. \"Many big brands have leveraged the opportunity, including perhaps two of the biggest brands in the world - Senator John Kerry and President George W. Bush,\" said chief executive Sam Yagan. There are some distinct advantages of advertising on such a network, he thinks. \"Peer-to-peer clients offer big brands a unique opportunity to engage with their customers where they\\'re most comfortable: at their desks interacting with their favourite digital media,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'US consumer confidence up\\n\\nConsumers\\' confidence in the state of the US economy is at its highest for five months and they are optimistic about 2005, an influential survey says.\\n\\nThe feel-good factor among US consumers rose in December for the first time since July according to new data. The Conference Board survey of 5,000 households pointed to renewed optimism about job creation and economic growth. US retailers have reported strong sales over the past 10 days after a slow start to the crucial festive season.\\n\\nAccording to figures also released on Tuesday, sales in shopping malls in the week to 25 December were 4.3% higher than in 2003 following a last minute rush. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has said its December sales are expected to be better than previously forecast because of strong post-Christmas sales.\\n\\nIt is expecting annual sales growth of between 1% and 3% for the month. Consumer confidence figures are considered a key economic indicator because consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the United States. \"The continuing economic expansion, combined with job growth, has consumers ending this year on a high note,\" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board\\'s consumer research centre. \"And consumers\\' outlook suggests that the economy will continue to expand in the first half of next year.\" The overall US economy has performed strongly in recent months, prompting the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates five times since June.\\n',\n",
       " 'Malik rejects all-black MP lists\\n\\nA call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and Asian MPs has been rejected by one of Labour\\'s most senior Asians.\\n\\nShahid Malik, who is on Labour\\'s ruling NEC, accepted people\\'s frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. Just 13 of Britain\\'s 659 MPs are from ethnic minority groups, he added. Commission for racial equality chief Trevor Phillips argued on Sunday the time had come for such shortlists. That came after it emerged that one of Britain\\'s most ethnically diverse constituency, West Ham, was to get a women-only shortlist for the next election following an NEC ruling.\\n\\nMr Phillips said changes to the race relations legislation might allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups. For example in West Ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates. \"If we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way,\" he said. He added: \"It would be terribly disappointing if in the least white constituency [West Ham] in the whole of Europe we didn\\'t have a minority candidate.\" Appearing on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, Mr Malik, who is himself running for the seat of Dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women-only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.\\n\\nBut he argued: \"I do think that there currently things that parties can do and which they aren\\'t doing... for example setting targets to ensure that existing democratic structures are more reflective.\" Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips\\' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul Boateng and Bernie Grant - in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. That was a rate of progress Ms Abbott described as \"painful\". \"I am a little older than Shahid and served on the National Executive Committee in the 1990s - I was the first black person on the NEC ... crossing our fingers and hoping we are going to get more black and Asian MP hasn\\'t worked,\" she said. \"The shortlist strategy works for women and I believe that it can be made to work for black and Asian people.\" On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation. \"We haven\\'t ruled out all-black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Desailly backs Blues revenge trip\\n\\nMarcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000. \"Things will be totally different this time,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.\\n\\nFormer Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian\\'s arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I\\'m happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it\\'s amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\"\\n',\n",

These were \"not intended to cause any offence to anyone on the Jewish community,\" Mr Blair insisted.\\n\\nOne poster depicted Mr Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, as flying pigs. Another pictured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said echoed the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare\\'s Merchant of Venice.\\n\\nOthers compared the image to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens\\' Oliver Twist. Labour has since taken the designs of its website, saying members had preferred other designs. During his interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr Blair said: \"I\\'ve been a very strong supporter of the Jewish community and Israel, and will always be so.\" Pressed on whether he would draw attention to Mr Howard\\'s Jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract Muslim support, he replied: \"The idea that I would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. It\\'s untrue. \"If you look what I do, I attack Michael Howard politically. I would never, ever, ever attack him on that basis.\"\\n\\nMr Blair also defended his party\\'s attitude towards the Jewish community, pointing out that it was his government that had introduced the Holocaust Memorial Day. He added that Labour also aggressively fought all forms of racism.\\n\\nNeither the Conservatives nor the Liberal Democrats wished to comment on Mr Blair\\'s words. The prime minister was speaking as London\\'s Labour mayor Ken Livingstone remains embroiled in a row over comments he made to a Jewish reporter from the city\\'s Evening Standard newspaper. Mr Blair repeated calls for the mayor to apologise for likening the reporter, Oliver Finegold, to a concentration camp guard. Mr Livingstone \"should have withdrawn the comment immediately\" once he realised the journalist was Jewish, said Mr Blair. \"I\\'m sure that is what in truth he wants to do. Well, he should do it.\" Mr Livingstone has said he could not sincerely say sorry for the comments he made, and claims he has been targeted by the newspaper. He conceded his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked.\\n',\n",
       " 'GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyout\\n\\nGeneral Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright.\\n\\nFiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. But Fiat\\'s heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. The pay-off means the two firms will unwind joint ventures, but Fiat will keep supplying diesel engines and the money will allow it to reduce its debt. Fiat\\'s shares on the Milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 GMT to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading. \"We now have absolute freedom to design our own future,\" said Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne.\\n\\nAnalysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. Fiat is to get 1bn euros immediately, with another 550m to follow within 90 days. The firm is Italy\\'s largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. For its part, GM was keen to ward off any criticism that the deal had been a mistake.\\n\\n\"We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat,\" said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner.\\n\\nThe Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright. German-US car firm DaimlerChrysler had been willing to buy the firm, but Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli did not want to give up control. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a \"put option\" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. As a result, the sell-off looked better and better for the Italians - and much worse for GM, which is struggling with its own loss-making European marques Opel and Saab. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM\\'s stake to 10%.\\n',\n",
       " 'New rules tackle \\'sham weddings\\'\\n\\nNew rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.\\n\\nFrom Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry. The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. But immigrants\\' group the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. When the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister Des Browne said: \"Our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse.\" Under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the UK only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.\\n\\nBut from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office \\'certificate of marriage approval\\'. To get a certificate, costing Â£135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the UK. Those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will have no right to marry in the UK.\\n\\nOnce they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in England or Wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. They can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were \"not proportionate\" and \"discriminatory\".\\n\\n\"These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. \"We\\'re currently taking a legal opinion on this. We\\'ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we\\'ll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,\" Ms Beynon said. The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a \"significant risk\" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were \"disproportionate\". The committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the Human Rights Act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added.\\n\\nOver the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. In January 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in Leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. And last November Samuel Amoah, a Belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the UK, was jailed for three years. Several other cases are currently going through the courts. The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions. Registrars\\' spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. \"They will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. Certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,\" Mr Rimmer said. Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. \"It may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it\\'s still not as difficult to marry in the UK than it is to marry, for example, in Holland, Germany or France. \"I think it\\'s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,\" Mr Rimmer said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Euronext joins bid battle for LSE\\n\\nPan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid.\\n\\n\"The approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require a response at this point,\" LSE said. Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said. Last week, the group rejected a Â£1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business. LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on Monday.\\n\\nThe offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. Experts now widely expect a bidding war for Europe\\'s biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of Â£1.4 trillion, to break out. Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.\\n\\nA weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse\\'s offer. \"Because we already own Liffe in London, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for Deutsche Boerse,\" the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. Euronext chief executive Jean-Francois Theodore is reported to have already held private talks with LSE\\'s chief executive Clara Furse. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE\\'s 533p a share closing price on Friday. However, Euronext said it could not guarantee \"at this stage\" that a firm offer would be made for LSE. There has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000.\\n',\n",

While IE\\'s market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%. Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998. Although there have been other preview versions of Firefox, version 1.0 was the first complete official program. \"It seems that people are switching from Microsoft\\'s Internet Explorer to Mozilla\\'s new Firefox browser,\" said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.\\n\\nMozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest. Mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise $250,000 (Â£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation. There was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release.\\n\\nThe figures echo similar research from net analyst WebSideStory which suggested that IE had 92.9% of users in October compared to 95.5% in June. Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark. Firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. That means people are free to adapt the software\\'s core code to create other innovative features, like add-ons or extensions to the program. Fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in Firefox than in IE. Paul Randle, Microsoft Windows Client product manager, responded to the figures: \"We certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. \"Microsoft continues to make significant investments in IE, including Service Pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for Internet Explorer.\" Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. Other browser software, like Opera and Apple\\'s Safari, are also challenging Microsoft\\'s grip on the browser market. Opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year.

De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week.

The painkillers - called COX-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as Celebrex and Vioxx. Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The FDA has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.\\n\\nPutting Vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at Merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.\\n\\nMerck voluntarily stopped sales of Vioxx on 30 September, a move which caused the firm\\'s fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (Â£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. Merck\\'s shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of Vioxx-related litigation. Alarm bells were rung by a research note called Approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.\\n\\nPfizer is still selling its Celebrex and Bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. Merck\\'s announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. Merck\\'s head of research Peter Kim said that it withdrew Vioxx \"based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies\". He went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. \"Given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in Approve makes Vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the US,\" Mr Kim explained.\\n\\nOn Thursday, David Graham from the FDA\\'s Office of Drug Safety told the advisory panel that \"there really doesn\\'t appear to be a need for Cox-2\" inhibitors. According to calculations presented to the US Senate by Dr Graham in November, Vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 American deaths. Facing stem criticism for its handling of the Vioxx case, the FDA said on Tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors. The European Medicines Agency also said doctors should be \"cautious\" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.\\n',\n",

William Trowbridge and Michael Chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. Since the first successful file-sharing network Napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of P2P technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy. But that is going to change very soon, according to the panel.\\n\\nThe music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate P2P networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks. But they have slowly realised that P2P is a good way to distribute content, said Travis Kalanick, founder and chairman of P2P network Red Swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it. They are just waiting to come up with \"business models\" that work for them, which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards.\\n\\nBut, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with P2P cannot not happen, said Michael Weiss, president of StreamCast Networks. Remembering the furore around VCRs when they first came out, Mr Weiss said: \"Old media always tries to stop new media. \"When they can\\'t stop it, they try to control it. Then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money.\" Once the courts decided that the VCR in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business. In August 2004, the San Francisco-based US Court of Appeals ruled in favour of Grokster and StreamCast, two file-sharing networks. The court said they were essentially in the same position that Sony was in the 1980s VCR battle, and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal.\\n\\nP2P networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files. Instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients. There are now many different types of P2P systems than work in different ways. P2P nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content. The BBC has already decided to embrace the technology. It aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use P2P technology to distribute them. The files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control. But the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many. The global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day. Legal music download services, like Apple iTunes, Napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content. Sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004, with 200 million tracks bought online in the US and Europe in 12 months, the IFPI reported this week. But such download services are very different from P2P networks, not least because of the financial aspect.\\n\\nThere are several money-spinning models that could turn P2P into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies. Paid-for-pass-along, in which firms receive money each time a file is shared, along with various DRM solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered. \"We see there are going to be different models for commoditising P2P,\" said Marc Morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm Overpeer.\\n\\n\"Consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together,\" agreed Mr Morgenstern. But many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry\\'s potential controlling grip on content and P2P technology by continuing to use it for their own creations. Unsigned bands, for example, use P2P networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign. \"Increasingly, what you are seeing on P2P is consumer-created content,\" said Derek Broes, from Microsoft. \"They will probably play an increasing role in helping P2P spread,\" he said. Looking into P2P\\'s future, file sharing is just the beginning for P2P networks, as far as Mr Broes is concerned. \"Once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now,\" he said. \"File-sharing is the tip of the iceberg.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Whitehall shredding increasing - Tories\\n\\nCivil servants have drastically stepped up the shredding of official documents, figures compiled by the Tories suggest.\\n\\nSome government departments had doubled the number of documents being shredded ahead of the Freedom of Information Act\\'s implementation on 1 January. Departments for defence, environment and trade, which had all increased file destruction, said they were following rules governing public records. But the Tories want the information commissioner to investigate. The Freedom of Information Act will for the first time give members of the public access to government records previously kept secret for 30 years. But BBC Political Correspondent James Hardy said the prospect of outsiders poking their noses into the inner workings of Whitehall appeared to be causing jitters among the mandarins.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat Alan Beith - who chairs the select committee which monitors the Department of Constitutional Affairs - said if the claims were true, Whitehall was \"acting entirely against the spirit of the new Act\". \"Both the information commissioner and the select committee will have to keep this issue under very close scrutiny.\" Fellow Lib Dem Norman Baker said the episode painted an \"unflattering picture of the inner workings of government\". \"It is clear that the government\\'s initial enthusiasm for open government has turned to self-serving cynicism.\" Dr Julian Lewis, the Conservative spokesman for the Cabinet Office, said he had discovered a huge acceleration in shredding from a series of parliamentary answers.\\n\\nThe Department of Work and Pensions destroyed nearly 37,000 files last year - up 22,000 on four years ago when the Act was passed. The number of files destroyed by the Ministry of Defence and the departments of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Trade and Industry has also risen dramatically. Dr Lewis has called for an investigation by the information commissioner Richard Thomas. Earlier this week, Mr Thomas said he was looking into Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old. He said he \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January.\\n\\nGovernment guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.\\n',\n",
       " 'Share boost for feud-hit Reliance\\n\\nThe board of Indian conglomerate Reliance has agreed a share buy-back, to counter the effects of a power struggle in the controlling family.\\n\\nThe buy-back is a victory for chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose idea it was. His brother Anil, the vice-chairman, said had not been consulted and that the buy-back was \"completely inappropriate and unnecessary\". The board hopes the move will reverse a 13% fall in Reliance\\'s shares since the feud became public last month. The company has been fractious since founder Dhirubhai Ambani died in 2002, leaving no will. \"Today\\'s round has gone to [Mukesh], there is no doubt about it,\" said Nanik Rupani, president of the Indian Merchants Chamber, a Bombay-based traders\\' body. The company plans to buy back 52 million shares at 570 rupees (Â£6.80; $13) apiece, a premium of more than 10% to its current market price.\\n',\n",
       " 'A November to remember\\n\\nLast Saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that England were still the number one side in the world.\\n\\nThat statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at Twickenham. But it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. The final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with Australia\\'s triumph in London followed by France\\'s capitulation to New Zealand. \"Clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,\" declared Wallabies coach Eddie Jones on arrival back in Sydney. \"There are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.\"\\n\\nWhile that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open Six Nations Championship for a decade. While the Wallabies, All Blacks and Springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to Super 12 matters in the new year, Europe\\'s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. And for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between England and France for the Six Nations title.\\n\\nThat owes much to Ireland\\'s continued progress and the belief that Wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.\\n\\n, who secured a first Triple Crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985. They start with away games against Italy and Scotland, before England and France come to Lansdowne Road.\\n\\nTheir momentous victory over the Springboks can only bolster Ireland\\'s self-belief, while Ronan O\\'Gara\\'s late drop goal to deliver victory over Argentina was further proof that Eddie O\\'Sullivan\\'s side can now close out tight games. Not that England or France, who have won nine of the last 10 Six Nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.\\n\\ndismantling of the Springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper.\\n\\nThe narrow defeat to Australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post-World Cup recovery have been sown by new head coach Andy Robinson. A fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if England emerge triumphant from an opening Six Nations engagement in Cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.\\n\\nare in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.\\n\\nWhile South Africa\\'s over-confidence in Cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, Wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the All Blacks in one of the best Tests in recent memory. If Mike Ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victories should not ensue come February. The last fortnight has left\\n\\nin a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over Australia. A stunning defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup, could have been attributed to trademark French inconsistency.\\n\\nBut the manner of New Zealand\\'s 45-6 demolition job in Paris has coach Bernard Laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. Fortunately for the French, the opening match of the Six Nations sees them entertaining\\n\\nin Paris. After two reasonable performances against Australia, the Scots\\' humbling by the Springboks forced coach Matt Williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. While individuals such as Chris Cusiter and Ali Hogg enhanced their reputations, a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.\\n\\n, who start with home games against Ireland and Wales before travelling to Scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the Championship. As autumn gives way to winter and the Heineken Cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of Six will keep the home fires burning until February.\\n',\n",
       " 'Analysis: No pain, no gain?\\n\\nHe called it his \"masochism strategy\" in the run-up to the Iraq war and now Tony Blair has signed up for another dose of pain.\\n\\nThe idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of \"real\" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras. The theory is that talking to the great British public, even if they are the \"great unwashed\", is better than having the media filter what voters hear from politicians. It is also the most effective way of showing that he is aware of real people\\'s concerns and - on occasions - of their outright fury. Mr Blair used the tactic before the Iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.\\n\\nLabour knows it has been damaged by accusations of spin, \"control freakery\" and over-slick presentation - sometimes from within the ranks of its own MPs. Tony Blair himself has said people complain he does not listen. Mr Blair\\'s latest bout of flagellation came with a series of questions sessions on Five television throughout Wednesday.\\n\\nThe trouble began on the Wright Stuff show, with Maria Hutchings marching up to him, saying \"Tony, that\\'s rubbish\" as she tried to complain about her autistic son\\'s school being threatened with closure. A few \"don\\'t worries\" as Mrs Hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show. But that was only the start and later sessions produced the type of grilling not even the toughest television interviewer could produce.\\n\\nWriter Neil Coppendale, from West Sussex, asked of the Iraq war: \"Tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children died - how do you manage to sleep at night?\" On immigration, London teacher Diane Granger said: \"Where are you going to put everyone?\" And can you imagine even Jeremy Paxman putting the question posed by Brighton nurse Marion Brown: \"Would you wipe somebody\\'s backside for Â£5?\"\\n\\nMr Blair tried to use the questioners\\' first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems. Many of the newspapers have branded the exercise a PR stunt which backfired. Indeed there is a danger Mr Blair simply ends up looking \"embattled\". Conservative Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat Charles Kennedy are to be offered chances to appear in similar slots on the channel next month. Labour strategists believe more of the sessions will mean the hecklers no longer become a story and the real issues take prominence.\\n\\nJames Humphreys, ex-head of corporate communications at Number 10, says the strategy shows frustration with the media. \"They feel they don\\'t get their voice across and going direct to people is clearly their game on this occasion,\" he says. There are risks but the prize is tackling the trend of lower turnouts at the polls, he argues. The prime minister knows full well the potential hazards .\\n\\nHe must remember with gritted teeth his confrontation with Sharron Storer, the Birmingham woman who harangued him over the state of her local hospital in the 2001 election campaign. \"All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you don\\'t do anything to help anybody,\" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately. Former Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell has described the episode as a \"bit of a disaster\" as it meant the launch of Labour\\'s election manifesto received little coverage. But it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive, not least because it coincided with John Prescott\\'s even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.\\n\\nFormer prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public. The undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was Margaret Thatcher discomfort on Nationwide in 1983, when viewer Diana Gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War. John Major reaped the benefits of street campaigning during the 1992 election campaign with his famous soapbox.\\n\\nIt may have left him splattered with eggs and engine oil at times but he felt it added \"fizz\" to his campaign. In his memoirs, he also argues the strategy contrasted with Neil Kinnock\\'s \"contrived photo opportunities\" and attempts at an artful campaign. \"He wanted to look like a prime minister. I\\n\\nwas\\n\\nprime minister and I wanted a flesh and blood fight,\" says Mr Major. Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could \"enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment\". But he also wants to counter complaints that he has spent too much time on international affairs and foreign trips. Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: \"Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.\" His hope must be that voters watching him on the rack will bear out for Labour the old maxim: \"No pain, no gain.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Cheaper chip for mobiles\\n\\nA mobile phone chip which combines a modem and a computer processor on one bit of silicon instead of two could make phones cheaper and more powerful.\\n\\nThe specially-designed chip, developed by Texas Instruments, could drive down the cost of making mobiles capable of 3D gaming and 30-frame-a-second video. Currently, rich multimedia features tend to be on more expensive handsets. The technology, OMAP-Vox, is being tested by firms in Europe and Asia and could appear by the end of the year. Texas, which makes computer chips for more than half the world\\'s mobile phones, said it was keen to make multimedia functions like video and gaming more affordable. \"We\\'re going to drive them down into meat-and-potatoes phones that have the largest market share,\" said Doug Rasor, a marketing vice president at Texas. The chip also uses much less power than conventional chips, said Texas, which means less strain on mobile battery life.\\n\\nMore than 50 million people own a mobile in the UK, but mobile operators are keen to encourage people to move onto more sophisticated handsets that can do more. Texas is keen to cash in on the third generation (3G) of mobile technology, which offers high-speed networks for video streaming and other multimedia functions. But it faces stiff competition from the likes of Intel which is also looking to provide better chips for high-end mobiles.\\n\\nCompetition to get people using 3G mobiles will grow in the next year as almost all of the UK\\'s operators have now launched third generation networks. A recent survey by Sony Ericsson predicted that the number of 3G handsets sold in 2005 would double from 2004 to account for 10% of all phones sold. Many consumers are still to be convinced though. A further recent survey said that only 4% of mobile owners were thinking of upgrading to 3G phones. Many said they were confused about the different ways to pay for phones and the vast array of features most have onboard.\\n\\nBut there will be continued demand for better chips as the industry continues to develop new standards and future networks. Earlier in January, NTT DoCoMo and Vodafone joined forces to develop the next generation of high-speed networks, known as \"super 3G\", intended to be 10 times faster than 3G services. The first stage of development is to be completed by 2007, but no date has been set for a commercial launch The newly-designed OMAP-Vox chip set was announced ahead of the start of a major mobile industry conference, 3GSM, which takes place in Cannes, France this week.\\n',\n",
       " 'BBC \\'should allow more scrutiny\\'\\n\\nMPs have urged the BBC to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how Â£2bn in licence fee money is spent.\\n\\nThe Public Accounts Committee called for the National Audit Office to be given a \"free hand\" to investigate how the BBC offers value for money. Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said. The call was made in a report into the BBC\\'s Freeview digital service. \"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money,\" said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh. \"The BBC\\'s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament. \"Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over Â£2 billion a year, is used.\"\\n\\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We share the committee\\'s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. Though in its infancy, we think the arrangements with the NAO are working well and should be given time to mature.\" The report said the Freeview digital service has had an \"impressive\" take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service. The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.\\n\\nThe report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date. The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen. There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. The corporation plans to spend up to Â£138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Reboot ordered for EU patent law\\n\\nA European Parliament committee has ordered a rewrite of the proposals for controversial new European Union rules which govern computer-based inventions.\\n\\nThe Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the Commission should re-submit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after MEPs failed to back it. It has had vocal critics who say it could favour large over small firms and impact open-source software innovation. Supporters say it would let firms protect their inventions. The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, \"computer implemented invention\". The draft law suffered setbacks when Poland, one of the largest EU member states, rejected its adoption twice in two months. Intense lobbying on the issue has started to gain momentum in some national parliaments putting them under immense pressure. Only two MEPs backed the draft law at the JURI meeting, with one voting to abstain.\\n\\nOpponents of the draft directive welcomed the decision and said a new first reading of the proposals would give the EU a chance to have fuller debates about its implications in all member states. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.\\n',\n",
       " 'Will Tory tax cuts lift spirits?\\n\\nMichael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.\\n\\nShould he win the next general election, he has earmarked Â£4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how. This was the pre-election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters, he believes, will warm to. At its simplest, it is saying: \"Vote Tory and you can have it both ways\". Not only would his government stick to Labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.\\n\\nAll the money would come from its Â£35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy, waste and the civil service. Of that, Â£23 billion would go on spending plans, with Â£8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.\\n\\nNeither Mr Howard nor Mr Letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash, although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely. Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election. As the Tory leader declared, the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between Labour and the Tories. \"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,\" he said.\\n\\nIt is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.\\n\\nThe extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters. And that is where one of the problems lies for Mr Howard - can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services AND lower taxes? He insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into Downing Street. Labour, needless to say, claim his planned Â£35bn efficiency savings simply don\\'t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.\\n\\nOne of New Labour\\'s greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters, business and the City that it could be trusted to run the economy. So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day. So, Mr Howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor. And, while other issues like the Iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign, it is likely - and the prime minister probably hopes - that the economy will be the deciding factor.\\n',\n",

Firms involved in the smart sensing system believe it will help trace attacks back to their source. Data gathered will be passed to police to help build up intelligence about who is behind worm outbreaks and denial of service attacks.\\n\\nFirms signing up for the sensing system include MCI, BT, Deutsche Telekom, Energis, NTT, Bell Canada and many others. The creation of the fingerprinting system has been brokered by US firm Arbor Networks and signatures of attacks will be passed to anyone suffering under the weight of an attack. Increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites, launch worms and relay spam around the net. \"We have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic,\" said Rob Pollard, sales director for Arbor Networks which is behind the fingerprinting system. \"Attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination,\" he said. Once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem.\\n\\nMr Pollard said Arbor was not charging for the service and it would pass on fingerprint data to every network affected. \"What we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source,\" said Mr Pollard. Arbor Network\\'s technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network. It spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups. Any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind. This type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines. Anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack. \"Attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated,\" said Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis. \"In the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we\\'ve seen massive growth.\" He said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks, often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks.\\n',\n",

       " 'Hewitt decries \\'career sexism\\'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour\\'s election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months\\' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n',\n",

Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights. On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.\\n\\nThe executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. More than 310 actions have already been raised in the Court of Session and sheriff courts in Scotland. An executive spokesman said: \"We will study this judgement in detail. Much has changed to address the issues raised in the Napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at Barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. \"Today\\'s judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases.\" Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought Â£5,000. He was awarded compensation last April after winning his case.\\n\\nExecutive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should \"be beyond reasonable doubt\". This is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in Scotland. However, civil litigation is settled on the test of \"a balance of probabilities\". Judge Lord Cullen, sitting with Lord Osborne and Lord Hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. Napier\\'s lawyer Tony Kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others. Mr Kelly said: \"There are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today\\'s judgement.\" Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been \"a fiasco from start to finish\". He said: \"Ministers were fully aware of the state of Scotland\\'s jails. Funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling I suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts. \"A short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost.\"\\n',\n",

The market\\'s buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Brazil is recovering from last year\\'s recession - its worst in a decade.\\n\\nEconomic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil\\'s first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy.\\n\\nInvestors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control.

Brazil\\'s currency, the real, also rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Friday. Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products. \"For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery,\" Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. \"Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control.\"\\n\\nInvestors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year\\'s economic crisis. This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers, thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies.

A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will decide the overall winner on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe five writers in line for the award won their respective categories - first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children\\'s book - on 6 January. Small Island, Levy\\'s fourth novel, is set in post-war London and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in the UK. \"What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It\\'s hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,\" wrote the judges. The judges called Guy\\'s My Heart is My Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots \"an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens\". Guy has published many histories, including one of Tudor England.

       " 'At a glance: Tory health checks\\n\\nThe UK\\' opposition Conservatives have unveiled plans to introduce health checks for immigrants if they win the General Election. Here\\'s a guide to the plan:\\n\\nPeople coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU. If they plan to stay six months or more and are from a country with lots of TB, they would have to have a chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate. All people from outside the European Union who want to stay a year or more will have to undergo a full medical.\\n\\nTuberculosis, Hepatitis B and HIV. A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down. All other conditions would be dealt with on a case by case basis.\\n\\nPeople would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. They would also, if appropriate, have to be able to undertake the work or study they applied to come here for.\\n\\nPeople coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching. Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB. Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.\\n\\nThe Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health. However, they will undergo health checks to ensure they receive the right medical treatment and do not spread infectious diseases.\\n\\nThey claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas. They also believe there should be stricter controls over who comes into Britain to ensure they are not a public health risk. They say the plans will protect access to the NHS.\\n\\nApplicants will be tested in their home country. Only asylum seekers will be tested in the UK once their refugee status is established.\\n\\nHome Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries. Recent medical checks were carried out on 175,000 people at Heathrow Airport and 10,000 at Gatwick. From those tests, about 100 infectious cases of TB were found.\\n\\nThe Tories say 47 other countries across the world impose requirements of this kind. The party has looked at the way the system is operated in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The Tory proposals are \"quite closely modelled\" on the New Zealand system.\\n\\nLabour claims the policy is little more than a \"desperate attempt to catch up with Labour\\'s five-year plan\" for immigration and asylum, which was published last week. This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance. Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. The Liberal Democrats have warned Labour and the Tories they were \"in danger of pandering to prejudice rather than challenging it\".\\n',\n",

That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,\" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: \"The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. \"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England.\" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson\\'s kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland\\'s line.\\n\\nBut centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. \"We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,\" he said. \"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. \"We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.\" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson.

Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. Mr Straw said the move would save Â£6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.\\n\\nHonorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. Nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in Europe and America.\\n\\nThey include Dallas in the US, Bordeaux in France and Oporto in Portugal, with local staff replacing UK representation in another 11. The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. Some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: \"The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\\'s strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. \"Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. \"In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.\"\\n\\nThe Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday\\'s cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. The shake-up is aimed at helping making Â£86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. \"But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.\\n',\n",

The move follows a Law Lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at Belmarsh prison, London, and Woodhill, Milton Keynes, was unlawful. The 12 affected by the ruling are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan. The government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 September to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.\\n\\nMr Clarke told The Times: \"I think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.\" He said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw \"in a very positive way\". Mr Clarke said that he was seeking \"memorandums of understanding\" between overseas governments and Britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. However, he added: \"I do not think the solution to the Law Lords\\' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. \"There are other strands that we have to do.\" But the Liberal Democrat\\'s shadow home secretary, Mark Oaten, accused Mr Clarke of avoiding the main issue with the Belmarsh detainees.\\n\\n\"The critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,\" he told BBC News. \"And I do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,\" Mr Oaten said. \"Deportation may tackle this initial problem but I want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.\" \"Unless we get that, the Liberal Democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in March.\"\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s home affairs correspondent, Daniel Sandford, said it appeared Mr Clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, David Blunkett. But he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees\\' home countries could be difficult. \"Some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it\\'s not an easy agreement to get and I think for some of these suspects it won\\'t be the solution.\" Daniel Sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. \"The government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,\" he said.\\n',\n",

But the Tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of Alzheimer\\'s, Parkinson\\'s and Motor Neurone disease. \"I believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,\" he said. The use of embryonic stem cells in the UK is already allowed. Stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body\\'s tissue types. Scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.\\n\\nMr Howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. But he argued: \"We mustn\\'t be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. \"Politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. \"With the life expectancy of the average Briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people\\'s lives as they grow older. \"I know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. They are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. \"I respect those concerns. But I also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like Parkinson\\'s, Multiple Sclerosis, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer\\'s and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.\"\\n\\nMr Howard acknowledged there were \"no easy answers\" over such an issue but it was necessary to \"have the courage to do what we know to be morally right\". He added: \"Of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. More research needs to be done. But we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. The hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved.\" Former Superman actor the late Christopher Reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident.

While the US economy is growing at a \"reasonably good pace\" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Pension and healthcare costs posed the greatest risks to the economy, he said.\\n\\nThe government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby-boom generation retires. \"I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. If existing promises need to be changed, those changes should be made sooner rather than later,\" Mr Greenspan said. He also warned that unless the nation sees unprecedented rises in productivity \"retirement and health programmes would need \"significant\" changes. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.\\n\\nMeanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. He also urged Congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the US heading further into the red. Despite the dire warnings, Mr Greenspan did offer some good news for the short term. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit. Recent increases in defence and homeland security spending were also not expected to continue indefinitely, which should cut some costs. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year.\\n',\n",

Castaignede told BBC Sport: \"The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England. \"But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road.\" Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world\\'s leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham. &lt;\\n\\nCastaignede said: \"You can\\'t say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte. \"Had England\\'s kickers not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now.\" Laporte has been criticised for France\\'s negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition\\'s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. \"All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland,\" said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. \"Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales.

Easymobile will allow customers to go online to order SIM cards and airtime - which will be rented from T-Mobile - for their existing handsets.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK bank seals South Korean deal\\n\\nUK-based bank Standard Chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (Â£1.8bn) to buy one of South Korea\\'s main retail banks.\\n\\nStandard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia\\'s third largest economy. Its shares fell nearly 3% in London as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth Â£1bn ($1.8bn), equal to 10% of its share capital. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.\\n\\nThe South Korean bank will also make up 22% of the group\\'s total assets. The move, a year after Citigroup beat Standard Chartered to buy Koram bank, would be the South Korean financial sector\\'s biggest foreign takeover. This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal. KFB is South Korea\\'s seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country\\'s banking market and an extensive branch network.\\n\\nThe country\\'s banking market is three times the size of Hong Kong\\'s with annual revenues of $44bn. Standard Chartered has its headquarters in London but does two thirds of its business in Asia, and much of the rest in Africa. \"We\\'re comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won,\" said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at a London press conference. Standard Chartered said KFB was a \"well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce\" and represented a \"significant acquisition in a growth market\". In London, Standard Chartered\\'s sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100\\'s 0.3% decline. Standard Chartered\\'s shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by April 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, Standard Chartered said.\\n\\nRival banking giant HSBC, which is based in London and Hong Kong, was also in the running. Standard Chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the Christmas break. \"They were able to move so quickly it caught HSBC by surprise,\" the Financial Times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea Exchange Bank, also currently in the hands of a US group. Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank\\'s complex dual ownership. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hands of US private equity group Newbridge Capital. Newbridge bought its stake during the government\\'s nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 Asia-wide currency crisis which crippled South Korea\\'s financial institutions.\\n\\nSouth Korea\\'s economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea\\'s service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. Services now make up roughly 40% of the economy, and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. In the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. Bad loan problems followed; LG Card, the country\\'s biggest credit card provider, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months, for instance. But analysts believe South Korea\\'s financial services industry is still in its infancy, offering plenty of scope for new products. Standard Chartered sees \"the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products\". Since 1999, KFB has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending, which makes up 45% of its loans.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fosters buys stake in winemaker\\n\\nAustralian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.\\n\\nFosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share. A bid at that price would value the company at A$3.1bn ($2.4bn; Â£1.25bn ). Fosters said it was currently in discussions \"which may lead to a major corporate announcement\".\\n\\nIn a separate statement, Southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. Both firms asked the Sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until Monday. Southcorp\\'s shares were suspended at A$4.25.\\n\\nFosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001. Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorp\\'s board following the share deal. Southcorp employs 2,700 people and is the largest single investor in rural Australia, according to its website. The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. It has cash available, after getting A$846m from selling property business Lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.\\n\\n\"People will scratching their heads over this one. Fosters has done a back-flip\", said Shawn Burns, a fund manger at Deutsche Asset Management. Southcorp\\'s shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. It spent two years in the red, returning to profit in 2004. Consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by Constellation, the world\\'s biggest winemaker. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. Since then, it has paid $1bn for US wine maker Robert Mondavi, bought last month. Fosters\\' main wine business is Beringer Blass Wine Estate. Its best known brand is Fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. Analysts were divided on Thursday about whether Fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of Southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. \"Currently, I think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover,\" said one analyst quoted by the Agence France Presse news agency. However, Matt Williams, a fund manager at Perpetual Trustees said taking the stake \"is definitely a precursor to a takeover\".\\n',\n",

Mr Blair told Five\\'s Wright Stuff show: \"Let\\'s just apologise and move on.\" Mr Livingstone has said the remarks may have been offensive but were not racist, and said he would not apologise even if the prime minister asked.\\n\\nMr Blair, who was instrumental in returning Mr Livingstone to the Labour Party, insisted on Wednesday it was time for the London mayor to say sorry.\\n\\n\"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise,\" he said. \"Let\\'s just apologise and move on - that\\'s the sensible thing.\" Tory leader Michael Howard, asked about Mr Livingstone\\'s remark by reporters, said it was important for politicians to be mindful about the language they use. \"It\\'s particularly important that as we get close to the election that politicians talk with civility and courtesy about issues that we all face,\" he said. \"I think it\\'s a matter of sadness that we are not seeing that from the Labour Party. We had what Ken Livingstone said, we had what Alastair Campbell has said and we have what others have said. I think that\\'s a matter of great regret.\"\\n\\nThe row blew up after Mr Livingstone was approached by Evening Standard reporter Oliver Finegold following a party marking the 20th anniversary of former Culture Secretary Chris Smith coming out as Britain\\'s first gay MP. On tape, Mr Livingstone, who once worked as a freelance restaurant critic on the paper, is heard asking Mr Finegold if he is a \"German war criminal\".\\n\\nMr Finegold replies: \"No, I\\'m Jewish, I wasn\\'t a German war criminal. I\\'m quite offended by that.\" The mayor then says: \"Ah right, well you might be, but actually you are like a concentration camp guard, you are just doing it because you are paid to, aren\\'t you?\" At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Mr Livingstone said his comments were not racist and refused to apologise. \"If you think they are racist, I think you are wrong,\" he told reporters. The dispute comes as an inspection team from the International Olympic committee began a four-day tour to assess London\\'s bid for the 2012 Games. An official complaint has been made to local government watchdogs by the British Jews, demanding an investigation by the Standards Board of England. It has the power to suspend or bar Mr Livingstone from public office.\\n',\n",
       " 'Standard Life concern at LSE bid\\n\\nStandard Life is the latest shareholder in Deutsche Boerse to express concern at the German stock market operator\\'s plans to buy the London Stock Exchange.\\n\\nIt said Deutsche Boerse had to show why its planned Â£1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the LSE was good for shareholder value. Reports say Standard Life, which owns a 1% stake in Deutsche Boerse, may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. Fellow shareholders US-based hedge fund Atticus Capital and UK-based TCI Fund Management have also expressed doubts.\\n\\nDeutsche Boerse\\'s supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the LSE despite the signs of opposition from investors. \"The onus is on Deutsche Boerse\\'s management to demonstrate why the purchase of the LSE creates more value for shareholders than other strategies, such as a buyback,\" said Richard Moffat, investment director of UK Equities at Standard Life Investments. Atticus Capital, holding 2% of Deutsche Boerse, wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the LSE. And TCI which holds about 5%, has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company\\'s entire supervisory board. It has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition, and whether the operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (Â£266m) to shareholders instead.\\n\\nIn December, Deutsche Boerse, which also owns the derivatives market Eurex and the clearing firm Clearstream, put an informal offer of 530 pence per LSE share on the table. However, the LSE said the cash offer \"undervalued\" both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. Since then an improved offer from Deutsche Boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with LSE chief executive Clara Furse. But the London exchange is also holding talks with Deutsche Boerse\\'s rival Euronext, which operates the Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris exchanges, as well as London-based international derivatives market Liffe.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fightstar take to the stage\\n\\nCharlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted.\\n\\nHe was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted\\'s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson\\'s departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\\n\\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted\\'s enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday\\'s press conference coinciding with the start of the band\\'s 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie\\'s first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick\\'s Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue\\'s Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\\n\\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson\\'s brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson\\'s guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar\\'s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted\\'s chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I\\'ve never heard them before, but I\\'m pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted\\'s sound, but they\\'re still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.\\n',\n",
       " 'Kilroy launches \\'Veritas\\' party\\n\\nEx-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration. He told a London news conference that Veritas - Latin for \"truth\" - would avoid the old parties\\' \"lies and spin\". UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. He said Veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said Veritas was joining \"an already crowded field on the right of British politics\". On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon\\'s Ashfield seat. He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP\\'s two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas\\' deputy leader. UKIP\\'s chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.\\n\\nMr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June\\'s European elections. \"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said. \"I will be standing at the next general election. I shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes I believe in. \"And, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.\"\\n\\nMr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party. A spokesman for UKIP called on Mr Hockney to quit the London Assembly. The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down. Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk. \"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now \\'goodbye\\',\" he said. UKIP officials also argue Mr Kilroy-Silk has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.\\n\\nVeritas? It\\'s the BNP in an expensive suit!\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that \\'Veritas\\' is a party that doesn\\'t believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that \\'Veritas\\' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. In my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-Islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.\\n\\nI think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. It really is time that the UK government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. In addition as an Ashfield constituent I would be more than interested in Kilroy -Silk opposing Geoff Hoon!!\\n\\nGood to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. Let\\'s hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe. We benefit enormously from our membership of the EU, we need to be at the heart of Europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.\\n\\nAll mouth and trousers. A clown. Trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping New Labour into a third term.\\n\\nWhatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England. This new party might gain support from right-wing England, but will have little impact in Wales or Scotland.\\n\\nHopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. England needs Europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can\\'t rely on the USA forever!\\n\\nAt last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. The electorate is disillusioned with British politics. Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I\\'ll be voting for him.\\n\\nBoth UKIP and RK-S are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. The interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people\\'s bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?\\n\\nMany people believe you Kilroy. You may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.\\n\\nThe very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating. One can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.\\n\\nI\\'ve always thought that Kilroy-Silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.\\n\\nBrilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!\\n\\nHaving seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. Hopefully the UKIP members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.\\n\\nFantastic news. Pro-Europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. The Conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-Europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, European and general elections. Robert Kilroy-Silk\\'s ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters\\') worst enemy.\\n\\nAs a euro-enthusiast I could not be more delighted by Kilroy-Silk\\'s behaviour. He took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d\\'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. The closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as I am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.\\n\\nIf every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we\\'d have ballot papers a mile long! You\\'ve got to hand it to Kilroy-Silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.\\n\\nWhilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP. I believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the EU and to show our people what belonging to the EU really means. The EU\\'s comments last week about Michael Howard\\'s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the EU and not individual member states. The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better\\n\\nDoes anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a \\'good old British\\' name? Is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous?\\n\\nI think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point. British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. They are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. As a result I feel our democracy is being abused and I want it stopped. If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.\\n\\nHonestly, who really cares? Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.\\n\\nAs one of Kilroy-Silk\\'s East Midlands constituents I hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. I feel insulted by having him represent me in the European Parliament.\\n\\nUKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. Someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of UKIP\\'s democratic nature.\\n\\nKilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not. He tried to make it work, but they didn\\'t seem to want to grow up. He was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy. Good luck to the man, I say.\\n\\nOh please! This is an amusing irrelevance. There is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive \\'Eurosceptic\\' argument. They will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic Europe Union. Future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.\\n\\nThe refreshing thing about Robert is that he is open, honest and straight. What other politician can claim this. I have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. I shall be voting for him.\\n\\nThe electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP. Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP\\'s party list. He has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the European Parliament.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t write off Kilroy-Silk. While he\\'s a clown and a one man band at the moment, he\\'s a populist and that\\'s always dangerous.The man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters, that seems to be one of the factors in success.\\n\\nGood luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.\\n\\nThe man I once found cringe worthy on Day time TV, could well turn out to be my country\\'s knight in shining armour. He expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me. What\\'s more, I look forward to the day when he claims victory, wrecks the EU, and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!\\n\\nGreat Stuff. The longer the UK dithers over Europe, the richer we in Ireland become, as the only English-speaking country fully committed to Europe. Oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.\\n\\nThis is just what the Europhiles pray for. As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe. Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.\\n\\nThank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!\\n\\nIt is very sad to see the cause of Britain regaining its proper relationship with Europe damaged by this split within UKIP. Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer. Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk. It is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.\\n\\nUKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU. This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. Neither the English Democrats nor the New Party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.\\n\\nIf he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.\\n\\nSo UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!\\n\\nInteresting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!\\n\\nEvery opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-Europe feeling in this country. Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. He is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. We wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. It needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities. Recruit the right colleagues, Robert, and your time may have come!\\n\\nWell if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary MP then go out and start up your own Party. It\\'s all flash and no real policy here\\n\\nLet\\'s hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.\\n\\nVeritas? The name will doom it. But perhaps I am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn Latin in the classroom do they not? The whole essence of what RKS represents is Euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of Veritas symbolises that?\\n',\n",
       " 'Markets fall on weak dollar fears\\n\\nRising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers\\' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.\\n\\nThe London FTSE fell 0.8% while Tokyo\\'s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its steepest fall in three months. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And Mr Greenspan warned Asian states could soon stop funding the US deficit.\\n\\nOn Monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. Oil pushed higher too on Monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the US and Europe and a potential output cut from oil producers\\' group Opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\\n\\nThe latest to pitch in has been President George W Bush himself, who told the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit in Chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. Together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across America\\'s public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. But he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. Some had looked to the G20 meeting for direction. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.\\n\\nFor the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.\\n\\nUS exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. In the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with Congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the US can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. But in a speech on Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world\\'s reserve currency. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns. But already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in August found few takers. And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.\\n',\n",

The new version of the film received little publicity and the original version is available across the US on DVD. \"We certainly had higher expectations than what we got,\" said Rob Schwartz, head of distribution for Newmarket Films, which released The Passion of the Christ. \"We were trying to get the film out there, hoping it would reach an audience that it didn\\'t quite reach the first time around. It doesn\\'t seem to have worked out quite as well as we had hoped.\" Meanwhile, Will Smith comedy Hitch has become the top film at the global box office after taking an estimated $30.1m (Â£15.6m) over the weekend at cinemas outside North America, according to industry website Screen Daily. It has taken $65.5m (Â£34.1m) so far, buoyed by opening at number one in the UK last weekend and a successful run in Germany. The movie, which cost a reported $70m (Â£36.4m) to make, has taken $138m (Â£72m) in the US so far.\\n',\n",

But media watchdog Ofcom has said the the commercially funded public service broadcaster will not be privatised. A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said there were no plans to sell the channel.\\n\\nHe added that primary legislation would be required for the station to be sold off, which the government was not intending to introduce. Brookside was axed in 2003 after its ratings slumped from a peak of seven million to just 1.5 million.

Stephen Toulouse, a security manager at Microsoft, said the malicious program was called Bankash-A Trojan and was being sent as an e-mail attachment. Microsoft said it did not believe the program was widespread and recommended users to use an anti-virus program. The program attempts to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress warning messages given to users.\\n\\nIt may also try to steal online banking passwords or other personal information by tracking users' keystrokes.\\n\\nMicrosoft said in a statement it is investigating what it called a criminal attack on its software.

       " 'Dozens held over ID fraud site\\n\\nTwenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud.\\n\\nThose arrested are accused of operating Shadowcrew.com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday. He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people\\'s identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov.\\n\\nInvestigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site\\'s 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes.\\n\\nShe said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver\\'s licences, passports and birth certificates. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: \"This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit.\\n\\n\"We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions.\" Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: \"The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. \"Your identity is one of the most precious commodities. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Deal to ban \\'homophobic\\' reggae\\n\\nThe reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups.\\n\\nA damaging campaign against stars such as Beenie Man and Sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted. The campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a UK police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. Brett Lock of gay group OutRage! said they were \"wiping the slate clean\". The protests had been led by the Stop Murder Music coalition, an umbrella group including OutRage!, the Black Gay Men\\'s Advisory Group and Jamaican movement J-Flag.\\n\\nThat coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene\\'s biggest stars. But the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. And it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. \"The reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,\" according to media and PR strategist Glen Yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.\\n\\nThe industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. \"We\\'ll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society.\" The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla\\'s UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August. Police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. The campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, Mr Yearwood admitted. \"If you can\\'t have major stars touring, then you don\\'t sell many albums,\" he said.\\n\\nBut the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. OutRage!\\'s Mr Lock said: \"The main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren\\'t any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. \"As a gesture of good faith, the Stop Murder Music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. \"So we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself.\" Record companies VP and Greensleeves, distributor Jet Star and concert promoters including Jammins and Apollo Entertainment are all on board.\\n',\n",

Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. For China\\'s aviation authorities, the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given.\\n\\nThe LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London, rather than New York for their listings. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. \"We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,\" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. \"The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world\\'s most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards,\" she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: \"We\\'ve been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now.\" As part of its pitch to bring listings to London, the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal, whilst stressing London\\'s strong regulatory environment.\\n\\nGermany\\'s Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began a three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing a deal worth 1bn euros ($1.3bn; Â£690m) for Airbus to sell 23 new planes to Air China, the Deutsche Welle radio station reported. China\\'s booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese, turning the country into a sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing. Air China\\'s long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China\\'s flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong. Air China\\'s primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks. The collapse last week of China Aviation Oil, the Singapore-listed arm of a Chinese jet fuel trader, has cast the spotlight on corporate governance shortcomings at Chinese firms.\\n',\n",
       " 'Franz Ferdinand\\'s art school lesson\\n\\nScottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, who shot to prominence in 2004, have won two Brit Awards.\\n\\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK\\'s art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\\n\\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry\\'s Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\\n\\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\\n\\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where\\'s the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\\n\\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I\\'m really glad it was almost comical because we weren\\'t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.\\n',\n",
       " 'Businesses fail to plan for HIV\\n\\nCompanies fail to draw up plans to cope with HIV/Aids until it affects 20% of people in a country, new research says.\\n\\nThe finding comes in a report published on Thursday by the World Economic Forum, Harvard and the UN aids agency. \"Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats,\" said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF\\'s global Health Initiative. Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action?\\n\\nDr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as \"too little, too late\". The issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the World Economic Forum, which meets in Davos, Switzerland, next week. The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible.\\n\\nOne company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce.\\n\\nOver the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. \"Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,\" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American.\\n\\n\"Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,\" he said. \"Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this.\" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called \"next wave\" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds \"an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,\" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health.\\n\\nThe WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.\\n',\n",

He was confident and fancied it. \"There were no questions that he\\'d miss it the way he was playing. He had a superb game.\" Jones was happy to hail Henson\\'s heroic contribution to Wales\\' first win over England in Cardiff since 1993. \"Physically he\\'s a specimen: he\\'s a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he\\'s got a great kicking game as well,\" Jones said.\\n\\n\"His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. \"I\\'m glad he\\'s Welsh.\" Victory over England for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what Wales might achieve in this year\\'s Six Nations. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and Scotland before completing their campaign against Ireland in Cardiff. \"People all over the world want to see Wales back at the top table of world rugby,\" said a proud coach Mike Ruddock. \"But we are not there yet. The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. \"We have to travel this week and we can\\'t afford to get too giddy about this result. \"We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy.\"\\n\\nNone more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O\\'Driscoll. The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. \"I\\'m the sort of player who likes pressure on me,\" he said. \"It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure. \"I set a high standard against England and I\\'ve got to back it up next week. \"Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn\\'t involved and we lost, so we\\'ve got to put that right next week.\"\\n',\n",

That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell\\'s campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq\\'s weapons of mass destruction dossier.\\n\\nThe affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard\\'s past.\\n\\nMr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. \"What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. \"In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. \"I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. \"I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.\"\\n\\nMr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning.

Open Water, Napoleon Dynamite, Garden State and Super-Size Me were all snapped up at last year\\'s festival. But stars like Keanu Reeves and Pierce Brosnan also have films showing there. The festival is being opened by a screening of quirky comedy Happy Endings, starring former Friends actress Lisa Kudrow and Maggie Gyllenhaal, on Thursday.\\n\\nKudrow\\'s Friends co-star, David Schwimmer, plays a divorced drunkard in Duane Hopwood, while Brosnan stars as a hit man in comedy The Matador.

Robert Redford founded Sundance in 1981 and it has gone on to showcase future successes such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project and The Full Monty. But it has received criticism that it has become more commercial and mainstream over the years. \"As much as the press argues that Sundance has completely changed, it hasn\\'t changed that much,\" festival director Geoffrey Gilmore said. \"It\\'s still a place for discovery.

But a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed that it would not be at GDC. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release their more powerful machines in the next 18 months. The next Xbox console is expected to go on sale at the end of the year, but very few details about it have been released. It is thought that the machine may be unveiled at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, which takes place in May, according to a Reuters news agency report. E3 concentrates on showing off the latest in gaming to publishers, marketers and retailers. The GDC is aimed more at game developers. Microsoft chief, Bill Gates, used the GDC event to unveil the original Xbox five years ago. Since its launch, Microsoft has sold 19.9 million units worldwide.\\n\\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, there was very little mention of the next generation gaming machine. In his keynote speech, Mr Gates only referred to it as playing an essential part of his vision of the digital lifestyle.\\n\\nBut the battle between the rival consoles to win gamers\\' hearts and thumbs will be extremely hard-fought. Sony has traditionally dominated the console market with its PlayStation 2. But earlier this year, Microsoft said it had reached a European milestone, selling five million consoles since its European launch in March 2002. Hit games like Halo 2, which was released in November, helped to buoy the sales figures.\\n\\nGamers are looking forward to the next generation of machines because they will have much more processing and graphical power.\\n\\nThey are also likely to pack in more features and technologies that make them more central as entertainment and communications hubs. Although details of PlayStation 3, Xenon, and Nintendo\\'s so-called Revolution, are yet to be finalised, developers are already working on titles. Rory Armes, studio general manager for games giant Electronic Arts (EA) in Europe, recently told the BBC News website in an interview that EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo\\'s kits. But, he added, the PlayStation 3 was rumoured to have \"a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2]\".\\n',\n",

The furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of Matt Dawson and Austin Healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media. \"The Lions is a massive media event,\" said Woodward, who will be the head coach. \"There will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media, the fans that will go out in their thousands and the New Zealand public. \"We need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring. \"[Alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself.

Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.\\n\\nIf he does move across to union, Wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially. \"I\\'m sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre,\" said Wells. \"I think England would prefer him to progress to a position in the back row where they can make use of some of his rugby league skills within the forwards. \"The jury is out on whether he can cross that divide. \"At this club, the balance will have to be struck between the cost of that gamble and the option of bringing in a ready-made replacement.\"\\n',\n",

Balfour Beatty's railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Balfour Beatty managers Anthony Walker and Nicholas Jeffries, and Railtrack managers Alistair Cook, Sean Fugill and Keith Lea all face individual charges. All five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. It is expected the trial could last as long as a year. The accident, on 17 October 2000, happened when the London to Leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. The accident on the East Coast Main Line sparked major disruption. The overall responsibility for the line was Railtrack's - the company that has now become Network Rail. Those who died in the accident were Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex; Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds; Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottingham; and Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand.\\n\",\n",
       " 'US to probe airline travel chaos\\n\\nThe US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines\\' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.\\n\\nStaff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff.\\n\\nTransportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was \"deeply concerned\" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair\\'s computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand \"what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath\".\\n\\nAdding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways\\' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate \"sickout\". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed.\\n\\nUS Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m.\\n\\n\"US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,\" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was \"embarrassed by the situation\" and \"deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,\" The probe will focus on the industry\\'s compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway\\'s ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair \"deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline\\'s crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,\" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.\\n',\n",

The SEC also said it had brought fraud charges against two ex-senior executives of Columbia Distributor. Columbia Distributor was part of FleetBoston, bought by BOA last year. Three other ex-Columbia executives agreed settlements with the SEC.\\n\\nThe SEC has set itself the task of stamping out the mutual funds\\' use of market-timing, a form of quick-fire, short-term share trading that harms the interests of small investors, with whom mutual funds are particularly popular. In the last two years, it has imposed penalties totalling nearly $2bn on 15 funds. The SEC unveiled two separate settlements, one covering BOA\\'s direct subsidiaries, and another for businesses that were part of FleetBoston at the time. In both cases, it said there had been secret deals to engage in market timing in mutual fund shares. The SEC agreed a deal totalling $375m with Banc of America Capital Management, BACAP Distributors and Banc of America Securities. It was made up of $250m to pay back gains from market timing, and $125m in penalties. It is to be paid to the damaged funds and their shareholders. Separately, the SEC said it had reached a $140m deal - equally split between penalties and compensation - in its probe into Columbia Management Advisors (CAM) and Columbia Funds Distributor (CFD) and three ex-Columbia executives. These businesses became part of BOA when it snapped up rival bank FleetBoston in a $47bn merger last March.\\n\\nThe SEC filed civil fraud charges in a Boston Federal court against James Tambone, who it says headed CFD\\'s sales operations, and his alleged second in command Robert Hussey. The SEC is pressing for the highest tier of financial penalties against the pair for \"multiple violations\", repayment of any personal gains, and an injunction to prevent future breaches, a spokeswoman for the SEC\\'s Boston office told the BBC. There was no immediate comment from the men\\'s\\' lawyers. The SEC\\'s settlement with CAM and CFD included agreements with three other ex-managers, Peter Martin, Erik Gustafson and Joseph Palombo, who paid personal financial penalties of between $50-100,000.\\n',\n",

The legal action accuses Mr Spector of murdering the actress at his LA home. Mr Spector is currently free on $1m (Â£535,000) bail and is awaiting trial. The 64-year-old has denied the killing, saying her death was accidental.\\n\\nMs Clarkson\\'s legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging he \"grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained\" Lana Clarkson before shooting her to death. Her lawyers said in a statement: \"The Clarkson family had hoped that there would be some resolution with regard to the criminal proceedings before moving forward with the civil action. \"However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes Mr Spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005.\" Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide. His lawyers, led by Bruce Cutler, have vowed to prove him innocent at trial.\\n\\nMr Cutler said: \"Phil did not cause the death of this woman, he\\'s not criminally responsible and he\\'s not civilly responsible either. \"But I\\'m not surprised they filed a suit for money, that seems to be de rigueur nowadays.\" A Los Angeles Superior Court judge is expected to set a trial date later this month for Spector, who was indicted on murder charges in September.

The only people who will know the Oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count.\\n\\nAfter collating the results, they are responsible for sealing the results in the famous golden envelopes which will be revealed by a host of celebrity presenters at the ceremony. Former Academy Award winners Gwyneth Paltrow, Dustin Hoffman and Halle Berry will also present prizes. The event at the Kodak Theatre will be attended by 3,300 people, including some of the best-known names in film, and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. One current concern is the torrential rain which has lashed Los Angeles for the past week, flooding suburbs and causing mudslides. It is hoped the forecast for Sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. \"The last time it rained on Oscars night was in the mid-to-late 1980s,\" said Oscars communications director John Pavlik. \"We have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the Oscar gods always shine on Sunday and we hope they will do so again this year,\" he added.\\n',\n",

The Lib Dems also oppose the proposals, but ministers insist they are proportionate to the terror threat.\\n\\nThe government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws lords said current detentions without trial broke human rights laws. New Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair has backed the control orders, saying: \"I\\'m sorry. It is a dilemma, but there is only one choice.\" But Mr Howard said: \"We have serious misgivings about both their effectiveness in protecting life and their consequences for the British way of life.\"\\n\\nHe argued that people accused of terrorist offences should be brought to trial and be held in prison - not at home - while they await trial. Mr Howard said he feared \"internment without trial creates martyrs\" and could be \"a very effective recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists\". His party plans to move an amendment to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill next week that would give a judge responsibility for assessing evidence and ensuring a balanced case is presented to the court. He called on the prime minister to \"enter into constructive discussions\" with his party to find a \"better way forward\". Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.\\n\\nHome Secretary Charles Clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the Egyptian man, known only as C, certified as a terrorist suspect. On Monday, the legal team for two Algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. Most of the terror suspects are detained at Belmarsh Prison in London. The Liberal Democrats say they also oppose house arrests and questioned the human rights implications of the measure. Home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"It\\'s a matter of principle for us that we can\\'t have a situation where the Home Secretary is able to impose house detention now on UK nationals as well as foreign nationals.\"\\n\\nThe Lib Dems believe the Home Secretary should allow phone tapping evidence in prosecutions. \"We think there could be a role for some form of control order - tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones - but not with the Home Secretary\\'s say so. That must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions,\" said Mr Oaten. Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk. He said prosecutions were the government\\'s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in \"serious\" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.\\n',\n",

But he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year\\'s tournament following complaints by several Australian players. But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on Hewitt\\'s performances over the years. \"Lleyton\\'s proving how versatile he is on all surfaces,\" he said. \"It is faster than last year and that\\'ll be faster than the one Lleyton beat Roger Federer on in the Davis Cup in 2003.\"\\n',\n",

On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It\\'s only when you\\'ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year.

       " \"Microsoft debuts security tools\\n\\nMicrosoft is releasing tools that clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware.\\n\\nThe virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to Microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. Also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. Although initially free it is thought that soon Microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.\\n\\nThe anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. Microsoft's Windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. It has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. Latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. Spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users' knowledge. In its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. The most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. Surveys have shown that most PCs are infested with spyware. Research by technology firms Earthlink and Webroot revealed that 90% of Windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. Before now Microsoft has left the market for PC security software to specialist firms such as Symantec, McAfee, Trend Micro and many others. It said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. On spyware freely available programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. Microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. In 2003 it bought Romanian firm GeCAD Software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. In December 2004 it bought New York-based anti-spyware firm Giant Company Software. Last year Microsoft also released the SP2 upgrade for Windows XP that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.\\n\",\n",

The French wine industry, the world\\'s second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of New World wines. Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners\\' representatives.\\n\\nThe bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. France fell behind the \\'New World\\' producers of Australia, Chile and the United States for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.\\n\\nDomestic consumption, accounting for 70% of sales, has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws.\\n\\nThe aid package would \"create a positive climate around French viticulture,\" Mr Bussereau said. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. \"I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,\" Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency. In an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. The support is designed to make French producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. Wine makers in France\\'s best-known regions, such as Burgundy, have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.\\n',\n",

And Australia said it was \"one of the best (meetings) we can recall in terms of substance\". Mr Johannesson also said progress \"on the bilateral market access side is accelerating\". Sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection. Some WTO members also dislike Russia\\'s energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.\\n',\n",
       " 'Uganda bans Vagina Monologues\\n\\nUganda\\'s authorities have banned the play The Vagina Monologues, due to open in the capital, Kampala this weekend.\\n\\nThe Ugandan Media Council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality. It said the production could go ahead if the organisers \"expunge all the offending parts\". But the organisers of the play say it raises awareness of sexual abuse against women. \"The play promotes illegal, unnatural sexual acts, homosexuality and prostitution, it should be and is hereby banned,\" the council\\'s ruling said.\\n\\nThe show, which has been a controversial sell-out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. Some parliamentarians and church leaders are also siding with the Media Council, Uganda\\'s New Vision newspaper reports. \"The play is obscene and pornographic although it was under the guise of women\\'s liberation,\" MP Kefa Ssempgani told parliament.\\n\\nBut the work\\'s author, US playwright Eve Ensler, says it is all about women\\'s empowerment. \"There is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina,\" Ms Ensler told the BBC. \"It\\'s not a slang word or dirty word it\\'s a biological, anatomical word.\" She said the play is being produced and performed by Ugandan women and it is not being forced on them. The four Ugandan NGOs organising the play intended to raise money to campaign to stop violence against women and to raise funds for the war-torn north of the country. \"I\\'m extremely outraged at the hypocrisy,\" the play\\'s organiser in Uganda, Sarah Mukasa, told the BBC\\'s Focus on Africa programme. \"I\\'m amazed that this country Uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women\\'s rights and the notions of free speech; yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Nuclear body seeks new tech\\n\\nThe computer systems used to monitor the world\\'s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors.\\n\\nA spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old. Such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide. The agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software. \"A major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information,\" said project manager Livio Costantini.\\n\\nIAEA inspectors make around 3,000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide. They are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants, to carry out environmental checks, and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.\\n\\nThe computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits, for instance, was built in the 1970s and largely paper based. An IAEA spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack. The organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in November, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant. Where possible, it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials. Further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries, according to a spokesman.\\n\\nComputer specialist at the IAEA, Peter Smith, would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques, more familiar to video games players, into the inspector\\'s toolkit. \"The commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world,\" he said. \"If we could have that on our laptops, we could be walking through the plant seeing, on the laptop, how the plant should look. \"And if there\\'s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop, then we have a problem.\" The IAEA estimates the total cost of the four-year project to upgrade its technology will be $40m. So far it has only received $11m from the US and the UK. \"Failure to replace the hardware and software, and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks,\" said an agency statement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown and Blair face new rift claims\\n\\nFor the umpteenth time, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.\\n\\nThis time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government\\'s global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. It dominated the prime minister\\'s monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. As he told journalists: \"I am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. There is a complete unity of purpose.\" And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election.\\n\\nSo why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown\\'s long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? By now Mr Blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. He snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. Well, not really, as it happens.\\n\\nAnd he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. Although in the next breath he declared: \"I get increasingly alarmed by what I read in the newspapers\" before catching himself on and quickly adding: \"In so far as I read them of course.\" He probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.\\n\\nAs far as the timing of the prime minister\\'s press conference is concerned, there are two options. The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. If that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. The second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous Downing Street grid - to avert just such allegations.\\n\\nEither way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. And there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. Firstly, the prime minister insisted on Wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get G8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government\\'s response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.\\n\\nThen, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Aid minister Hilary Benn and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott - without mentioning the other. All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. The fact that he used an article in the Guardian newspaper to set out what he believed \"should\" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of Britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit Africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister\\'s \"turf\" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. But the big fear with many on the Labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.\\n',\n",
       " 'Funding cut hits Wales Students\\n\\nThe Wales Students rugby side has become a casualty of the Welsh Rugby Union\\'s reorganisation at youth level.\\n\\nAn amalgamated Under-18 side formed from separate schools and national youth teams plays its first match on Thursday, against Italy at the Gnoll. But that move has seen the WRU decide to end its funding of representative sides such as Wales Students. As a result, traditional international fixtures against England and France in the New Year have been cancelled. The Welsh Students Rugby Football Union feels that it is unable to properly prepare for or stage the matches. The secretary of the Welsh Students Rugby Football Union, Reverend Eldon Phillips, said: \"It is a shame that fixtures cannot be maintained this year. \"The competition provided by the strong English and French teams has enabled the Welsh Students to test themselves in high quality matches. \"The increasing number of young rugby players entering Higher Education look for the biggest challenge, that is representative rugby, but this year that opportunity will be denied them. Players who have played for Wales Students before going on to win full senior representative honours include Robert Jones, Rob Howley, Jon Humphreys, Darren Morris, Martyn Williams and Ceri Sweeney.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sydney to host north v south game\\n\\nSydney will host a northern versus southern hemisphere charity match in June or July, the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) said on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe match will include players from the Lions tour of New Zealand. \"The Australian Rugby Union has thrown its support behind a proposed North-South match to raise funds for the tsunami appeals,\" the ARU said. The date is yet to be decided but the most likely venue is Sydney\\'s Olympic Stadium. ARU chief executive Gary Flowers said the world cricket charity match in Melbourne earlier this month had inspired the ARU. \"We still need to discuss the options with the IRB (International Rugby Board), the Lions and our SANZAR (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia Rugby) partners, but June or July is seen as a better option than March to ensure we have the cream of southern hemisphere rugby available,\" he said. Wallabies captain George Gregan said the charity match was a \"great initiative\". Tri-Nations rivals Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would feature prominently in a southern team against a northern side comprised of Six Nations teams France, Ireland, England, Wales, Italy and Scotland. Coach Clive Woodward\\'s Lions squad will tour New Zealand in June and July, including Tests on 25 June, 2 and 9 July.\\n\\nAlmost 80,000 fans packed into Melbourne Cricket Ground on 10 January for a charity match that raised Â£5.9m for victims of the Asian tsunami.\\n',\n",

Unions have already earmarked 23 March for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million UK workers. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.\\n\\nPCS leader Mark Serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.\\n\\n\"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn\\'t it ironic that they\\'re saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it\\'s completely unacceptable.\" BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the General Election. A stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.\\n\\nOpposition to raising the retirement age is \"one thing all the unions are agreed on\", our correspondent added. Unison\\'s 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers\\' Union\\'s 70,000 and Amicus\\' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on Thursday night.

There was \"some possibility\" of the strike action being avoided, he added.\\n',\n",

Robben had been expected to be out for six weeks, but Meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital Stamford Bridge game on 8 March. \"I hope he can be back and I will try to help him make that happen,\" Meersseman told the Mail on Sunday. \"I put everything right with Arjen\\'s foot the last time I saw him 12 days ago. It was an obvious correction and easy to perform. \"I know he was pleased with what I did and now that he is running again. I am due to see him one more time again in the next few days.\" Meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at Italian side AC Milan.\\n',\n",

Ethiopian duo Gebre Gebremariam and Dejene Berhanu made last-gasp efforts to overtake him, but Kipchoge responded and a burst of speed clinched victory. Gavin Thompson was the first Briton in 12th place while Nick McCormick held of his British rivals to win the 4km race.

In the women\\'s race, Ethiopia\\'s Tirunesh Dibaba won a battle with world cross country champion Benita Johnson to retain her title.

But the FA confirmed: \"There will be no further action taken in this matter.\" Mourinho claimed his \\'silence\\' gesture was aimed at the media, although they were on the other side of the ground. The former Porto coach was forced to watch the climax of his side\\'s 3-2 victory over Liverpool on television after being ushered away from the touchline by fourth official Phil Crossley. His gesture came after Chelsea\\'s equaliser on 79 minutes courtesy of a Steven Gerrard own goal. Mourinho still faces an FA investigation into his allegation that Manchester United\\'s players \\'cheated\\' during January\\'s Carling Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge.\\n\\nAnd Uefa could also launch disciplinary action following Mourinho\\'s failure to attend a compulsory post-match press conference after Chelsea\\'s Champions League defeat at Barcelona last week. In addition, some time this month, Chelsea must also answer a charge of failing to control their players during the Premiership win at Blackburn in February. And a charge of failing to control their supporters following a Carling Cup meeting with West Ham earlier this season is still to be heard.

       " 'White prepared for battle\\n\\nTough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England\\'s Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.\\n\\nThe Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. \"The Welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.\" White is also impressed with the Welsh pack\\'s strength in depth. \"Gethin Jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,\" he added. The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.\\n\\nHe destroyed South Africa\\'s Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White\\'s presence this season. The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup. \"I am pleased with my form,\" he said. \"But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. \"It\\'s been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants. \"I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.\" White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.\\n\\nAnd with 27 caps and a World Cup winner\\'s medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon. \"I don\\'t know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,\" he added. \"When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.\\n\\n\"It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. \"I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.\" White missed the vast majority of last year\\'s Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff. \"I enjoy the atmosphere. The Millennium Stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,\" he said. \"To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it\\'s one of my favourite places to play. \"This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. England, Ireland, France and Wales are all contenders. \"On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don\\'t know - that\\'s the great thing about this tournament.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'How the Academy Awards flourished\\n\\nThe 77th annual Academy Awards are taking place on 27 February with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. But from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?\\n\\nHOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.\\n\\nJust 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.\\n\\nThe first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. WHEN AND WHERE The tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.\\n\\nThe ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Other venues included the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium. They are now held at the Kodak Theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. Until 1954 they were held on a Thursday, then swapped around from Monday to Wednesday before Sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from May to April to March and now its current month of February. The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC. WHO WAS OSCAR? There is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as Oscar.\\n\\nOne popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. A journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.\\n\\nThe first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn\\'s first best actress win in 1934. The Academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. Since its inception 2,530 Oscars have been handed out. In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII. After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. Fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. There are now 5,700 members of the Academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. THE STARS WHO LEFT EMPTY-HANDED While many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the Academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.\\n\\nAmong the overlooked films were Hobson\\'s Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, The Searchers and King Kong. Actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer (1927), Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1944), Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952) and Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men (1957). Alfred Hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. His enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. THE SHOW ALWAYS GOES ON Not even war has halted the glittering Hollywood event. There were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in Iraq, but as it didn\\'t stop during World War II or the Vietnam war.\\n\\nDocumentary winner Michael Moore ensured nobody forgot about the Iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the American invasion. The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. The ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. Los Angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers\\' Guild was striking at the time. Marlon Brando turned down his best actor Oscar for The Godfather in 1973 in protest as Hollywood\\'s apparent discrimination against Native American people. He sent along a woman called Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his award. She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.\\n\\nThe following year Robert Opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. The TV network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. Opal was murdered in 1979. Frank Capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, Frank\" to which Frank Capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant Frank Lloyd had won for Cavalcade.\\n\\nCapra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night.\\n',\n",

Kenteris and Thanou could be suspended for up to two years. The duo withdrew from the Olympics after missing a test but claimed they had suffered a motorcycle crash. The Greek authorities have also brought criminal charges against the sprinters for avoiding a drugs test and faking an accident. Their former coach Christos Tzekos is also facing charges and all three are awaiting a trial date.\\n\\nHowever, the IAAF will determine the sprinters' future on the track after carefully considering all the evidence. The sport's ruling body is expected to direct the Greek federation in what action it should take against the sprinters. Kenteris and Thanou can appeal against any decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The sprinters both sent written explanations to the IAAF, which have been taken into account. The IAAF sent an official warning to the sprinters and coach Tzekos after they were discovered training in Qatar rather than in Crete, where they had said they would be. But Kenteris and Thanou then went on to skip tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago, when they decided to fly back to Greece early. Just before the Olympics, the pair dramatically missed another test in Athens before withdrawing from the Games. Kenteris, 31, won gold in the 200m at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where Thanou, 29, won silver in the 100m.\\n\",\n",

Speaking to Parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following David Blunkett\\'s resignation, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year. \"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\"\\n\\nMrs Robinson said the Law Lords\\' ruling was \"in line with international legal opinion\" and praised their \"very decisive\" eight to one majority. \"What the Law Lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn\\'t apply to British citizens,\" she said.\\n\\nMrs Robinson warned that a lack of action by the British government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. \"If the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the Law Lords.\" She said a meeting of the Club of Madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the Spanish capital on the March anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. \"I have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at, both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles, but also the response of the British government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.\"\\n\\nThe detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office\\'s powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\". The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.\\n',\n",
       " 'Newest EU members underpin growth\\n\\nThe European Union\\'s newest members will bolster Europe\\'s economic growth in 2005, according to a new report.\\n\\nThe eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said. In contrast, the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a \"lacklustre\" performance, generating growth of only 1.8%. The global economy will slow in 2005, the UNECE forecasts, due to widespread weakness in consumer demand.\\n\\nIt warned that growth could also be threatened by attempts to reduce the United States\\' huge current account deficit which, in turn, might lead to significant volatility in exchange rates.\\n\\nUNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. However, total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. This is due largely to the faltering German economy, which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. On Monday, Germany\\'s BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005.\\n\\nSeparately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany\\'s efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented \"huge risks\" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent\\'s growth. Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent\\'s best performing economies this year, it said. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.\\n\\nConsumer demand will remain fragile in many of Europe\\'s largest countries and economies will be mostly driven by growth in exports. \"In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to \\'wait and see\\', the organisation said in its report. Global economic growth is expected to fall from 5% in 2004 to 4.25% despite the continued strength of the Chinese and US economies. The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties. \"The orderly reversal of the deficit is a major challenge for policy makers in both the United States and other economies,\" it noted.\\n',\n",
       " 'EC calls truce in deficit battle\\n\\nThe European Commission (EC) has called a truce in its battle with France and Germany over breaching deficit limits.\\n\\nThe move came after France and Germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the EU cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. But, the EC did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. Under EU rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. France and Germany will breach that this year. It will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the European Union\\'s Stability and Growth Pact rules.\\n\\nThe eurozone\\'s two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in November 2003 when they persuaded fellow EU members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.\\n\\nThe commission then took the pair to the European Court of Human Justice - which ruled EU countries could not put the pact \"in abeyance\", and confirmed the EC\\'s right to launch \"excessive debt procedures\". After announcing its decision to erase France and Germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the EU said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget\\'s below 3%. \"The commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,\" it said in a statement. The EU expects the German deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of GDP next year from 3.9% this year, while France\\'s is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. The forecasts are based on EC predictions of GDP growth of 1.5% in Germany next year and 2.2% in France.\\n\\nBerlin welcomed the decision, with finance minister Hans Eichel saying it showed that the EC recognised Germany\\'s fiscal policy was \"on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions\". However Paris was more subdued, with finance minister Herve Gaymard telling parliament: \"We must continue along this path of saving money.\" However, the move still had its critics, with the European People\\'s Party (EPP) attacking the EC for backing down from punitive action. \"The Commission is buckling under the pressure from Germany and France, \" EPP spokesman Alexander Radwan said. \"The scary fact is that budget sinners, despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit, do not have to fear any sanctions.\" Despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies, it refused to comment on similar action against Greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said that it was a matter for next week.\\n',\n",

England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. \"They\\'ve probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley,\" added Andrew, a former England fly-half and goal-kicker.\\n\\n\"They\\'re both pretty good kickers. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. \"But it\\'s all about pressure and unfortunately England are just not handling the pressure at the moment.\" Andrew also blamed England\\'s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. \"They just didn\\'t have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations,\" he said. \"I think it is really difficult for Jason Robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.\" Meanwhile, former England full-back Dusty Hare put England\\'s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.\\n\\n\"Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate,\" Hare told BBC Radio Five Live. \"But natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do. \"You have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.\" Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late. \"The top golfers don\\'t hit the fairway every time, and it is the same with goal-kicking,\" Hare added. \"You need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over, but great goal-kickers like Jonny Wilkinson come along very rarely.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Finding new homes for old phones\\n\\nRe-using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.\\n\\nResearch has found that in some developing nations old mobile phones can help close the digital divide. The Forum for the Future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations. But the Forum found that more needed to be done to collect old phones rather than let them rot in landfill sites.\\n\\nThe report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the UK. Of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re-use. The slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates James Goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the Forum for the Future. \"It\\'s quite common for people to have two or three phones just lying around,\" said Mr Goodman.\\n\\nMany of these older phones could end up in landfill sites leaking the potentially toxic materials they are made of into the wider world, said Mr Goodman. Far better, he said, to hand the phone back to an operator who can send it overseas where it can enjoy a second lease of life. \"We\\'ve heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back,\" said Mr Goodman, \"but there\\'s a strong social argument too.\" Older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model. The Forum for the Future report took an in-depth look at Romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular. \"It\\'s an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network,\" said Mr Goodman, \"and there\\'s a real desire for people to get mobile phones.\" But the relatively low wages in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone. \"The affordability of the handsets is a real barrier to getting one,\" he said. Reconditioned handsets have boosted take-up of mobiles as the report revealed that almost one-third of Romanian pre-pay mobile phone users were using reconditioned handsets. The re-used handsets tend to be about one-third of the price of a new handset. Georgeta Minciu, a Romanian part-time cleaner, said: \"Normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. I am a single parent - keeping in touch with my daughter is important to me.\" \"This is the only way I can afford to have a phone,\" she said. Mr Goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of Britain\\'s mobile mountain made it overseas. But, he added, those keen to use a mobile will not accept any old handset. \"If its more than a few years old people are not going to want it,\" he said.\\n',\n",

He understood that \"the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights\", Mr Blair told the Guardian newspaper. Mr Bush was sworn in at a ceremony in Washington DC on Thursday.\\n\\nEchoing the new US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of US policy since the war in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with Mr Bush. The president understood that while military and security measures were important, there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world\\'s problems.\\n\\nTurning to critics\\' fears that the US was poised for further military action, Mr Blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against Iran. The prime minister conceded that the US had \"what appears to be a harder position\" towards the state than Europe. But the prime minister pointed out that until now the US had allowed Britain, France and Germany to take the lead in trying to halt the Iranian nuclear programme. Following claims that US forces had worked inside Iran to identify potential targets, Mr Blair was asked if the SAS had also been in the country. \"We never answer questions about special forces, but do not take that as indicating an affirmative,\" said Mr Blair.\\n\\nMr Blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights. \"It is significant, in my view, that he is coming to Europe as his first foreign visit,\" said Mr Blair.

Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game. Top players also get a contract with the Four-Kings team which will pay travelling expenses for the contest.\\n\\nUK gamers have until 12 November to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the Four-Kings, Jolt.co.uk and Painkiller tournament websites. Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game. He said the clan was running the contest because Four-Kings does not currently have any players that excel at Painkiller. These eight players will be brought together in London on 3-5 December for the Bloodline Tournament that will find the best two players.\\n\\nThe event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch. The movie is being put together by Simon Bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online. Said Mr Bysshe: \"Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up.\" Painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter. These two players will be put forward as the UK\\'s entrants to the Cyberathlete Professional League $1m Painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005. The event is being billed as the CPL World Tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. Travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by Four-Kings for the two UK players who make the grade. The top prize at each stop on the world tour will be $15,000. A further $150,000 will be given to the winner of the Grand Final due to be held in December 2005. Mr Wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year. The first stop on the world tour will be Istanbul, Turkey from 10-13 February. A total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer. The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. Counter-Strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. The decision to pick Painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that Doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title.\\n',\n",

The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\\n\\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years\\' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\\n\\n\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\\n\\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world\\'s leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\\n\\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"\\n',\n",

Barclays has declined to comment on the report in the Sunday Express, saying it does not respond to market speculation. The two banks reportedly held talks in October and November 2004.\\n\\nBarclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in London on Monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the FTSE 100 index. UK banking icon Barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. Its North American divisions focus on business banking, whereas Wells Fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. In 2003, Barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to Â£3.8bn, and it has recently forecast similar gains in 2004, predicting that full year pre-tax profits would rise 18% to Â£4.5bn. Wells Fargo had net income of $6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, and revenues of $28.4bn. Barclays was the focus of takeover speculation in August, when it was linked to Citigroup, though no bid has ever materialised. Stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports heralded a deal. \"The chief executive would be abandoning his duty if he didn\\'t talk to rivals, but a deal doesn\\'t seem likely,\" Reuters quoted one trader as saying.\\n',\n",

It will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be \"limited\". Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs. Either PCs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through Microsoft\\'s site. Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and \"add-ons\" that the software giant offers.\\n\\nPeople who try to manually download security patches will have to let Microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs. Some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more PCs left unprotected. But Graham Cluley, senior consultant at security firm Sophos, told the BBC News website that it was a positive decision. \"It sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of Windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,\" he said. Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. Software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. The company announced earlier in January that it was releasing security tools to clean up PCs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of PCs are infected with. The virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to Microsoft\\'s dedicated anti-virus software. Last year it introduced the Windows XP Counterfeit Project, a UK-based pilot scheme, which ran from November to December. The scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November could replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones for free. It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows. \"China in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,\" said Mr Cluley.\\n',\n",

Including those connected via cable, almost six million people have a fast, always-on connection. The boom has been fuelled by fierce competition and falling prices, as well as the greater availability of broadband over the phone line. \"The take-up rate for broadband is accelerating at a terrific pace,\" said Ben Verwaayen, BT\\'s chief executive. \"We will be in a very strong position to hit our five million target by summer 2006 much earlier than we had previously expected.\"\\n\\nThe last million connections were made over the past four months, with thousands of people being added to the total every day of the week.\\n\\nThose signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK\\'s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond six kilometres. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. According to BT, more than 95% of UK homes and businesses can receive broadband over the phone line. It aims to extend this figure to 99.4% by next summer.

The Lib Dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. The information commissioner\\'s office says surveys are allowed but there is a \"grey\" area if personal data is kept. Telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.\\n\\nBut seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. Both schemes are run by the Direct Marketing Association and backed by EU directives on privacy and electronic communications.\\n\\nThe rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. But that does not mean Labour and the Tories are not calling people signed up to the TPS. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. But that did not happen for \"voter identification\" calls. \"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said. \"So it is not covered by the Telephone Preference Service.\"\\n\\nHe said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers. She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law. We would not do things that are not allowed in the law.\" A spokesman for the Information Commissioner\\'s Office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. But the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. \"If a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.\\n\\nThe spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. The spokesman said there was \"no yes or no\" answer and the area was \"pretty grey\". He added: \"If someone complained, then we would investigate that. Political parties are aware of the regulations. At the last by-elections, we reminded them.\" Lib Dem chairman Matthew Taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: \"The advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal.\" He says evidence from local Lib Dem parties around the country suggests there are \"significant\" numbers of such calls. \"I hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,\" he tells the commissioner. Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.\\n',\n",

It is the highest ever daily total recorded by the Mobile Data Association (MDA). It represents an increase of 20% on last year\\'s figures.\\n\\nWishing a Happy New Year to friends and family via text message has become a staple ingredient of the year\\'s largest party. While texting has not quite overtaken the old-fashioned phone call, it is heading that way, said Mike Short, chairman of the MDA. \"In the case of a New Years Eve party, texting is useful if you are unable to speak or hear because of a noisy background,\" he said. There were also lots of messages sent internationally, where different time zones made traditional calls unfeasible, he said. The British love affair with texting shows no signs of abating and the annual total for 2004 is set to exceed 25bn, according to MDA. The MDA predicts that 2005 could see more than 30bn text messages sent in the UK. \"We thought texting might slow down as MMS took off but we have seen no sign of that,\" said Mr Short.

It is about a player thinking he is bigger than this club. \"No individual is, be it the chairman, the manager or a player.\" Souness dropped Bellamy for Sunday\\'s game against Arsenal, claiming the Welshman had feigned injury after being asked to play out of position. \"When I heard what the manager was saying I was in shock,\" Bellamy said. \"I thought \\'not only has he gone behind my back, he\\'s lying\\',\" he said in response to Souness\\' remarks. And the Wales international refused to apologise. \"I won\\'t apologise because I have done nothing wrong,\" he told the Evening Chronicle. \"There\\'s no doubt about it, I am out of here.\" The difficult relationship between Souness and Bellamy boiled over at the weekend, and has led to a war of words in the media.\\n\\nBellamy\\'s claim that Souness had lied about the background to the bust-up was strongly denied by Shepherd, who accused the striker of \"cheating\" the club. \"I wish to put the record straight regarding the Bellamy situation,\" said Shepherd. \"Craig walked off the training ground saying his hamstring was tight (on Friday), but what he failed to reveal was that he had told other members of the squad before training that he intended to feign injury. \"When Graeme discovered this he immediately ordered Bellamy to attend a meeting in my office. \"At that meeting Bellamy admitted to Graeme and I that he had told the players that he was going to \"fake\" an injury in training and walk off. \"He also agreed at that meeting to apologise to his team-mates for his behaviour. He didn\\'t do this which resulted in the action taken by the manager at the weekend, which I fully support. \"In my book this is cheating on the club, the supporters, the manager and his own team-mates. \"He is paid extremely well and I consider his behaviour to be totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional.\"\\n\\nBellamy\\'s latest outburst would appear to make his chances of a first-team recall remote. But even before Newcastle said the player would not be sold, Bellamy insisted he had no intention of handing in a transfer request. \"I don\\'t want the fans to think for one minute that I wouldn\\'t play for this club,\" he said. \"I\\'d play anywhere for this club, even in goal. \"It\\'s a very difficult situation for me at the moment but I\\'d never ask to leave this club. \"This club means so much to me. I couldn\\'t do it because I know I couldn\\'t come back here and play against Newcastle. It would hurt too much.\"\\n',\n",

Radio 1 said the show would not try to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. Peel died after suffering a heart attack in Peru in October. Radio 1 said the three DJs had been chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\". Rob Da Bank has been hosting The John Peel Show since the DJ\\'s death. He is also one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show that plays a mix of old and new electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens is currently one half of the Radio 1 Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in Wales. And Ras Kwame is the host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra. His show is dedicated to showcasing the best of UK black music and broadcasts live sessions, often giving new artists their first chance to perform on live national radio.\\n\\nAll of the three DJs will continue to host their current shows on Radio 1. \"It is widely accepted that John Peel can never be replaced,\" said the radio station. It added that One Music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said: \"It will seek out those making music for music\\'s sake rather than for commercial success. \"Above all it will provide support to emerging genres of music and styles that have not yet and may never reach the mainstream.\"\\n\\nOne Music is not new to Radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. Radio 1\\'s controller, Andy Parfitt, said: \"We believe that by having a series of DJs hosting a selection of shows under the One Music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on.\" Stephens said he grew up \"listening to John\" and that it was a \"massive honour\" to continue Peel\\'s work championing new music. The show will be broadcast from 1 February on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2300 GMT - 0100 GMT.\\n',\n",

The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. Turkcell said the decision \"increases the risks\" attached to the project. Although the company\\'s statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. \"The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,\" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.\\n\\nTurkcell\\'s mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran\\'s new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.\\n',\n",

It also plans to develop a \"worldwide entertainment concept\" with the brand, although details are not yet known. The groundbreaking Commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.\\n\\nIn the chronology of home computing, Commodore was one of the pioneers.\\n\\nThe Commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home PCs. It was followed a few years later by the Amiga. The Commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. The brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. Commodore International filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to Dutch firm Tulip Computers. In the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to Atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as Infogrames.\\n\\nTulip Computers sold several products under the Commodore name, including portable USB storage devices and digital music players. It had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. Commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for Windows PC, Apple Mac and even PDAs so that the original Commodore games can be still run.

And he added: \"It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. \"Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period. I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks.\" Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March. \"The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month,\" Banks told the club\\'s website. \"One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. \"But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months.\"\\n\\nDavid Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan.

       " 'MPs\\' murder sentence concern\\n\\nMurder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new MPs\\' report.\\n\\nThe influential Commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. The MPs also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. Committee chairman John Denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.\\n\\n\"The committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor.\" At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. But although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims\\' relatives are unhappy. In July this year Amanda Champion\\'s killer, James Ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.\\n\\nAmanda\\'s uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: \"Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence.\" MPs criticised Home Secretary David Blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.\\n\\nThe measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after Mr Blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.\\n\\nAs a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to \"remove ambiguity\" over how murderers should be sentenced. It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. The committee said the plans had not reflected the \"public disquiet\" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. Lord Woolf\\'s Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. As a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.\\n\\nMr Denham believes the SGC should reconsider its proposals to reflect Parliament\\'s wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. He said: \"We want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances.\" But a spokesman for the Home Office defended the proposals. He said: \"By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. \"We stand by the provisions in the Act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.\"\\n\\nShadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. \"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government\\'s claim to be tough on crime,\" he said. But Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten warned the MPs\\' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. \"The danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different,\" he told BBC News.\\n',\n",
       " 'Council tax rise \\'reasonable\\'\\n\\nWelsh councils should set their taxes at \"reasonable levels\" after being given an average funding increase of 6%, says the assembly government.\\n\\nFinance Minister Sue Essex said it was a \"good deal\" for local government. The Â£3.2bn settlement includes the \"full\" Â£7.4m from the UK Treasury announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown. But opposition parties said rebanding of council taxes would mean steep rises. In addition, Â£13.4m will come from the business support grant - a scheme which enables local authorities to keep part of business rates. She said where spending rises were kept to around 5% she was \"confident that councils will be able to set council taxes at reasonable levels.\" The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) had said on the eve of the announcement said that \"significant\" cuts to services may still be unavoidable. After the announcement WLGA finance spokesman Bob Wellington, of Torfaen, said it was vital that rises were minimsed. \"A limited amount of money has come available but this is not the answer to our problems,\" said Mr Wellington. \"It is vital that we start now to plan for future years and accept that resources will continue to reduce while pressures on services increase.\" On Monday, a delegation of north Wales councils visited Ms Essex to lobby for increased funds. Ms Essex said: \"I have listened to the views of local government and council tax payers and recognise the funding pressures and the concerns they have about council tax rises. \"I have met a large number of local authorities in recent weeks and I am aware of the pressures on them to provide local services and keep down the level of council tax, particularly for those people to are moving up a band due to the revaluation of domestic properties.\" She said council taxes could be kept at reasonable levels, \"even for those people who have moved up a band\".\\n\\nThe settlement includes a rise in the grant to help councils with the most deprived communities and a 16.4% rise in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex said: \"This is a good deal for local government, which will allow the well-managed councils of Wales to develop their services and charge reasonable levels of council tax. It is now a matter for council leaders to manage their budgets at a local level.\" Plaid Cymru\\'s local government spokesman Dai Lloyd called the announcement \"hugely disappointing\". He said: \"Wales and its local authorities have been short changed yet again. This is not whinging as the Labour Assembly Government so often claims - it is anger.\" \"This will mean either a massive hike in council tax, massive cuts in services provided by councils, or both.\" Mike German, leader of the Liberal Democrats in the assembly, claimed that one in three homes were still likely to face council tax rises due to rebanding. Mr German said: \"I know from my discussions with Welsh Liberal Democrat council leaders that they are doing their utmost to keep council tax to a minimum. But the random redistribution effect of rebanding...will create a great deal of difficulty.\" Conservative local government spokesman Glyn Davies said that for the minister to claim that the majority of council tax payers in Wales should see very little change \"is taking spin to the very verge of deception\". He added: \"Around a third of Welsh households have been re-valued upwards by at least one band and inevitably face increases into double figures.\"\\n',\n",

The voice features, based on IBM technology, are currently only available in the Windows version. Opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create \"style sheets\", its developers say. This will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. But the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. \"Our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,\" said Opera spokeswoman, Berit Hanson. \"So we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.\"\\n\\nAnother feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.\\n\\nThe company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using Opera with a handheld device. The company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. \"Our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,\" said Ms Hanson. \"People are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience.\" Unlike commercially available voice recognition software, Opera does not have to be \"trained\" to recognise an individual voice. Around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. The voice recognition function is currently only available in English. Opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support.

Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online \"day of action\" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers\\' arrests, is still being held.\\n\\nA spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi\\'s sentence as \"harsh\" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. \"The authorities are trying to make an example of him,\" the organisation said in a statement.\\n\\n\"By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.\" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda.

The music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. Ease of use, relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of MP3 players.\\n\\nFull-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. But the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated MP3 players are numbered.\\n\\nGilles Babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm Musiwave, said: \"Music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music.\"\\n\\nMusiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and Mr Babinet said the industry was enjoying \"definite momentum.\" But there are hurdles to overcome. Mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival Apple\\'s 60GB iPod. But the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. \"We are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices,\" Jonas Guest, vice president for entertainment at Nokia, told the BBC News website. But will mobiles become mere storage devices? \"One of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while PCs are used for downloading,\" said Mr Babinet\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want people to cast aside their PCs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems,\" explained Mr Guest. \"You must enable people to transfer music from a PC to a handset and vice versa.\"\\n\\nOne of the key elements of the Nokia and Microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a PC. Microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. Songs can be downloaded on PC or mobile and transferred between the platforms. \"The line between online and wireless is going to blur,\" predicted Ted Cohen, senior vice president of digital development and distribution at EMI. He said: \"The market is more regional in its maturity. In Asia it is beyond belief. \"The majority of our digital revenues in Asia comes from mobiles. In North America it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in Europe.\"\\n\\nEMI currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by PCs and mobile phones. Mr Cohen said: \"It\\'s going to be just as important to connect through 3G or wireless as it is through your PC. \"We want music to be a continuum.\" The seamless experience of mobiles and PC downloads is approaching, he predicted. Mr Babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over PCs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. \"Getting music from your PC onto a device is not an easy experience. You have to switch the PC on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music. \"All of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone.\" He said the mobile phone\\'s billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads, because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group.\\n\\n\"Certainly, we have a problem with battery, memory and bandwidth.

       " 'Jones files Conte lawsuit\\n\\nMarion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nThe Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (Â£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: \"I stand by everything I said\". Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she \"has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs\". Conte\\'s statements, the suit added, were \"false and malicious\". After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones\\' lawyer Richard Nicholls said: \"Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. \"Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America\\'s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte\\'s statements have been wildly contradictory. \"Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.\\n\\n\"Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.\" The sport\\'s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte\\'s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte \"for further information\". But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte\\'s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. \"If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,\" he added. \"The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. \"And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.\" Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.\\n',\n",

Virgin Blue, which is 25% owned by Richard Branson, has been struggling to fend off pressure from rival Jetstar. It cut its full year passenger number forecast by \"approximately 2.5%\". Virgin Blue reported a 22% fall in first quarter profits in August 2004 due to tough competition. In November, first half profits were down due to slack demand and rising fuel costs. Virgin Blue was launched four years ago and now has roughly one third of Australia\\'s domestic airline market. But the national carrier, Qantas, has fought back with its own budget airline, Jetstar, which took to the skies in May 2004. Sydney-listed Virgin Blue\\'s shares recovered slightly to close 12% down on Wednesday.

Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup\\'s other businesses. For Metlife, the US\\'s leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.\\n\\nRobert Benmosche, Metlife\\'s chairman and chief executive, said that it was a \"great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup\". Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m.

But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score \"cheap political points\" by muddling immigration with asylum.\\n\\nLondon\\'s Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. \"That\\'s not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country,\" he said.\\n\\n\"We want more migration, more people come to study and to work. \"We want more people coming to look for refuge.\" Mr Blair\\'s was asked last Wednesday if the government\\'s new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration.

Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said. The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate \"amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group\".\\n\\nMany of those who ended up taking their own lives had \"presented themselves\" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided.\\n\\nIncreased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: \"Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.\\n\\n\"Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives.\" \"These highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. \"Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. \"Until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and meet our duty of care to them.\"\\n\\nThe committee also highlighted \"deeply worrying\" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. Between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. It picked out the case of Joseph Scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in Stoke Heath Young Offender Institution in March 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. It revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times. Even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order.

The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career. \"I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on,\" Giggs said. \"He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years\\' time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there. \"The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough.\"\\n\\nGiggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm. The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed. However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option. \"For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, it\\'s his 50th cap and he\\'s known for some time about that,\" Toshack said. On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: \"It\\'s my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in. \"It\\'s important to be here, all the players feel the same. It\\'s a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. \"I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons. \"The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event. \"I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay. \"A lot can happen, but I\\'m hoping to be around.\" Giggs\\' own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two. \"I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment,\" said Giggs. \"It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that. \"I\\'ve heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out. \"I\\'m enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it. \"We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so it\\'s an important time.\"\\n',\n",

Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. \"Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,\" said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. \"The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.\"\\n\\nThe figures come after the Bank of England said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade.

It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.\\n\\nThe ODPM data showed the average house price was Â£192,713 in England; Â£139,544 in Wales; Â£116,542 in Scotland, and Â£111,314 in Northern Ireland.\\n\\nAll areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%.

He only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting Liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry. But to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that Liverpool still mean business.\\n\\nBy business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to Liverpool is Parry\\'s mission. Parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager Rafael Benitez. And his enthusiasm for the Spaniard\\'s personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. Benitez\\'s early work has given Parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. But it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. This will not come as news to Parry, a lifelong Liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...\\n\\nCaptain Gerrard is central to Liverpool\\'s plans and Parry\\'s insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. As ever, the player will have the final say, and Parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for Liverpool and Gerrard to flourish.\\n\\nIn terms of the search for new investment, Hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in March 2004. Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. BBC Sport understands Morgan is still ready and willing to invest in Liverpool, and Parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.\\n\\nMorgan, however, has had no formal contact with Liverpool or their advisors since last December, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his Â£70m offer. He was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from Liverpool. Morgan will certainly not be making another call. So speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the Middle East and America, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from Anfield.\\n\\nParry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to Liverpool\\'s future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. He is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future Liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. Parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in North London that has re-shaped Liverpool\\'s thinking.\\n\\nLiverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of Arsenal\\'s stunning Â£100m deal for their new Emirates Stadium at Ashburton has changed the landscape. Parry labelled the deal \"an eye-opener\" and admits Liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. He knows some traditionalist Liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just \\'Anfield\\', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.\\n\\nI would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?\\n\\nÂ£50m for Gerrard? I don\\'t care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard\\'s quality.\\n\\nThrough a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.\\n\\nCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn\\'t walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.\\n\\nÂ£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard\\'s transfer for any fee over Â£35m.\\n\\nParry\\'s statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.\\n\\nI would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.\\n\\nThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn\\'t, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football.\\n',\n",

The film, A Different Story, chronicles Michael\\'s life and career from the 1980s and his personal struggles. The 41-year-old chart-topper told reporters in the German capital that he wanted to \"move his career into a different form\", but added that he does not know what it is going to be yet.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still going to be making music,\" he said, but added that he was \"not going to be around\". He hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry, and said: \"I don\\'t really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who I feel I want to spar with.\" Michael said that the film, directed by Southan Morris, would put his two decades of fame into context. \"It\\'s almost as much for me as for my fans, in terms of trying to make sense of the last 22 years and bring it to a close in a proper way,\" he said. The documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze, from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo Wham! to his arrest for lewd conduct in a Los Angeles toilet in 1998. The film also deals with the loss of Michael\\'s partner Anselmo Feleppa from an Aids-related condition in 1993. A Different Story, which is being shown at the Berlin Film Festival, has been screened by BBC One.\\n',\n",

The closing list gave Scott odds of 6-9, followed by Oscar nominee Clive Owen at 5-2. Scott first found fame in the TV series Soldier Soldier and has since then starred in such films as Mission Impossible II and the wartime drama Enigma.\\n\\nMr Adams said one punter had placed a bet of Â£870 on the 39-year-old actor at odds of 8-1. \"She told us she had some inside information, perhaps she knew he had been to a casting, but she wouldn\\'t say,\" he said. Others thought to be in the running include Star Wars actor Ewan McGregor and Australian star Hugh Jackman, both of whom have odds of 4-1. Colin Farrell, Jude Law and Troy star Eric Bana have also been tipped for the role in the past.\\n\\nA large number of bets on actor Colin Salmon to become the first black James Bond were dismissed as a publicity stunt a month ago. The next Bond film, originally due for release in 2005, has been delayed until 2006 due to Sony\\'s takeover of the MGM studio. The most recent, Die Another Day, was released in late 2002 and saw Pierce Brosnan make his final appearance as the secret agent. The actor was originally due to make a fifth appearance as Bond, but was released from his contract in 2004.\\n',\n",

The actor began his film career in the 1940s, playing Macduff to Orson Welles' Macbeth in 1948, and was also a regular in on the Dublin stage. He later appeared in Robocop and its sequel and cult TV show Twin Peaks. He played the CEO of Omni Consumer Products in 1987's Robocop and Robocop 2 three years later, and was saw mill owner Andrew Packard in Twin Peaks, also in 1990.

       " 'Turkey deal \\'to help world peace\\'\\n\\nA deal bringing Turkey a step closer to EU membership is of \"fundamental importance\" to the peace and security of the world, Tony Blair has said.\\n\\nThe deal, struck at the European Council last week, also proved claims of a clash between Muslims and Christians were \"wrong\", Mr Blair said. It represented the achievement of an \"historic British objective\", he added. Tory leader Michael Howard said the deal laid to rest any suggestion the EU was \"anti-Islamic\".\\n\\nTurkey\\'s involvement with the EU would provide an \"invaluable bridge\" between Europe and the rest of the world, Mr Howard added. But the Tory leader argued that the EU constitution was not designed to take in a country as large as Turkey. Mr Blair has been a leading advocate of Turkish membership despite controversy surrounding the idea. He insisted that the Turkish leadership had made great advances in improving its human rights records. The deal to open formal talks with Ankara came despite an EU demand for Turkey to recognise Cyprus.\\n\\nIt was agreed the issue can be tackled at a later date but Turkish premier Recep Erdogan had to accept negotiations did not guarantee his country full EU membership. The internationally recognised southern part of Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a \"red line\". It could take up to 15 years before Turkey is able to join, and entry cannot be guaranteed. If it joins, Turkey may have to accept restrictions to limit migration by its citizens. The EU has also announced that it will start accession talks with Croatia in April 2005. However, talks will begin only if the country co-operates fully with the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\\n',\n",

Redknapp, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: \"I will not go down the road - no chance.\" Pompey coach Kevin Bond is poised to join Redknapp, who will be Saints\\' third boss of the season. Redknapp\\'s first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric said he was \"disappointed\" by the news and claimed Redknapp had been in talks with Southampton for \"some time\".\\n\\n\"It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time,\" Mandaric said on Portsmouth\\'s official website. \"I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed.\" According to Mandaric, Redknapp vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. \"I said to Harry \\'I hope you don\\'t go to Southampton\\', and he told me \\'absolutely not\\',\" he said. \"I\\'m wouldn\\'t say I\\'m bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it\\'s Harry\\'s life and it\\'s his decision.\" Redknapp became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with Mandaric\\'s decision to bring in Velimir Zajec as executive director.\\n\\nSouthampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary\\'s. But results under Wigley have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. When Redknapp\\'s appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints\\' ninth manager in eight years.\\n',\n",
       " 'Kenyan school turns to handhelds\\n\\nAt the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.\\n\\nThey are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. \"The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals.\" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. \"It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.\"\\n\\nThe system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. \"It\\'s very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it\\'s also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.\"\\n\\nThe project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. \"The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.\" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world\\'s largest university libraries. \"All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard\" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. \"We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.\" Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project\\'s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. \"Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.\"\\n',\n",

Local favourite Lleyton Hewitt will meet France\\'s Arnaud Clement, while defending champion and world number one Roger Federer faces Fabrice Santoro. Women\\'s top seed Lindsay Davenport drew Spanish veteran Conchita Martinez.\\n\\nHenman came from two sets down to defeat Saulnier in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year\\'s first major and is lined up to meet Roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. \"He\\'s tough player on any surface, he\\'s got a lot of ability,\" he said. \"We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I\\'m going to need to play well from the outset because he\\'s a dangerous competitor.\" Switzerland\\'s Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten Santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. \"It\\'s a tricky match,\" Federer said. \"I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. \"The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.\" The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion Andre Agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian Marat Safin, the player he beat in last year\\'s final.\\n\\nEighth-seeded American Agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed Andy Roddick will open his campaign against Irakli Labadze of Georgia. The American could meet Rusedski in the second round, seventh seed Henman in the quarter-finals and Hewitt in the last four. Hewitt is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mark Edmondson in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to Federer, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.\\n\\nIn the women\\'s draw, Davenport could encounter eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked Anastasia Myskina, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. Venus Williams, who lost to younger sister Serena in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. Serena Williams, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 Australian Open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed Amelie Mauresmo, a runner-up in 1999.

The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia\\'s flagging economy. Georgia\\'s black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.\\n\\nMr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia\\'s fragile public finances.\\n\\nThe new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. \"There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"Documentation about where this money came from doesn\\'t exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"\\n\\nBy declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", Mr Saakashvili stressed.\\n\\n\"No one will have the right to check this money\\'s origin. This money must go back into the economy.\" The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue.

Other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. \"You are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,\" he said. \"But you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it\\'s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.\"\\n\\nThe plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. Another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the House of Lords on Tuesday. Ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the Lords have over-ruled this. Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament. The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament. What they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.\\n',\n",

The Canadian music manager, who also managed Tommy Hunter and the Statler Brothers, had been in declining health, according to his family. An entrepreneur from an early age, Mr Holiff served as a rear air gunner in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II, afterwards setting up a drive-in restaurant. He briefly dabbled in acting, before setting up offices in Nashville and Los Angeles for his concert and artist promotion business. In 1970, RPM weekly magazine presented Holiff with a special award as the Canadian music industry\\'s man of the year. Mr Holiff retired when he was in his late 40s, returning to education as a mature student at the University of Victoria, where he graduated with a degree in history. He passed away on 17 March.

The owner of brands such as Dairy Milk, Dr Pepper and Snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the UK. Cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. \"While the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,\" said chief executive Todd Stitzer.\\n\\nThe modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in December that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in Europe.\\n\\nCadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. Growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including Cadbury, Trident and Halls - which enjoyed a \"successful\" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. Drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in US carbonated soft drinks, led by Dr Pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in Europe. Cadbury added that its Fuel for Growth cost-cutting programme had saved Â£75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to Â£100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. The programme is set to close 20% of the group\\'s factories and shed 10% of the workforce. Cadbury Schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the UK.\\n',\n",

The Basque newspaper Gara apparently received a telephone call saying a bomb was due to explode at 2100 local time. But after searching the stadium with sniffer dogs, the police said that no explosive device had been found.\\n\\n\"The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,\" said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. \"The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us.\" Madrid midfielder Guti told private Spanish radio station Cadena Ser: \"I have never seen this before and sport should be above it all.\" Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot. Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. It is not yet clear if the remaining three minutes of the game will be played at a later date or if the result will be allowed to stand.\\n\\nIf the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. Initial reports suggested the Basque separatist group ETA may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final. A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.\\n',\n",

Broadcasters such as Sky and ITV could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported.\\n\\nSky set-top boxes have two slots. One is for the viewer\\'s decryption card, while the other has been dormant until now.\\n\\nLoyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. Now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel TV. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. \"Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card,\" said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher.\\n\\nViewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley. Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming. \"The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players,\" said Mr Whalley. For the BBC, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley. Currently most Freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. Some 7.4 million households have Sky boxes and Sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.\\n',\n",

President Viktor Yushchenko, elected in December, is planning to revisit many of Ukraine's recent privatisations. Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.\\n\\nMr Yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises. More than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union was dismantled. Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.\\n\\nThursday's ruling by a district court in Perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. The consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by Viktor Pinchuk, son-in-law of former-President Leonid Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest man. The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold. Mr Yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn. One of the foreign bidders who lost out, steel giant LNM, told BBC News that it would be interested in any renewed sale.\\n\",\n",
       " 'PlayStation 3 processor unveiled\\n\\nThe Cell processor, which will drive Sony\\'s PlayStation 3, will run 10-times faster than current PC chips, its designers have said.\\n\\nSony, IBM and Toshiba, who have been working on the Cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on Monday. It is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new PlayStation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. The chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 GHz, the firms said. By comparison, rival chip maker Intel\\'s fastest processor runs at 3.8 GHz. Details of the chip were released at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in San Francisco. The new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between Intel and the Cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. The PlayStation 3 is expected in 2006, while Toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. IBM has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.\\n\\nCell is comprised of several computing engines, or cores. A core based on IBM\\'s Power architecture controls eight \"synergistic\" processing centres. In all, they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences, compared with two for current Intel chips.\\n\\nLater this year, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices plan to release their own \"multicore\" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. The Cell\\'s specifications suggest the PlayStation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems. \"Any new technology like this has two components,\" said Steve Kleynhans, an analyst with Meta Group. He said: \"It has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it. \"Then there\\'s the reality of how it\\'s really going to be used, which generally is several levels down the chain from there.\"\\n\\nWhile the PlayStation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use Cell, the chip\\'s designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. Initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, because the first version of the Cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. And while marketing speak describes the chip as a \"supercomputer\" - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world\\'s top 500 supercomputers. IBM said Cell was \"OS neutral\" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if Microsoft\\'s Windows was among those tested with the chip. If Cell is to challenge Intel\\'s range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside PCs, which predominantly run using Windows.\\n',\n",

The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe\\'s biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of Â£1.4 trillion.\\n\\nEuronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe. Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake.\\n\\nEuronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors. It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE\\'s rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than Â£3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid.\\n\\nLast week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had \"been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented\". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert\\'s negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.\\n',\n",

It is based on the children's book by English writer Diana Wynne Jones. It has registered the highest opening weekend takings of any Japanese film in the country, according to trade publication Screen Daily.\\n\\nThe film is about an 18-year-old girl who is trapped in an old woman's body after being put under a spell by a witch. Its two-day takings represented 1.1 million cinema admissions, Screen Daily said. The film's distributor Toho expects 40 million people to see it in total - almost one third of the country's population - it added. The film won the Golden Osella for outstanding technical contribution at this year's Venice Film Festival.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Industrial output falls in Japan\\n\\nJapanese industrial output fell in October while unemployment rose, casting further doubt on the strength of the country\\'s economic recovery.\\n\\nProduction dropped 1.6% in October, reflecting a decline in exports, while unemployment levels edged up 0.1% to 4.7%, slightly higher than forecast. The economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. Japan\\'s government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand.\\n\\nAnalysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.\\n\\nAccording to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. Although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. \"It\\'s a sign that the economy\\'s adjustment phase is stronger than expected,\" said Takashi Yamanaka, an economist with UFJ Bank. Japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year.\\n\\nGrowth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending September 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. Experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. Japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. \"The outlook for November is positive so I don\\'t think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in October,\" said a METI official. Despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years. The comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the Nikkei down 1% in afternoon trade.\\n',\n",
       " 'Brown in appeal for Labour unity\\n\\nGordon Brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed Mr Blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.\\n\\nThe chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be \"diverted or distracted\" from tackling the challenges faced by the country. His only \"motivation\" was to ensure Labour was re-elected, he insisted. Mr Blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for Gordon Brown as old news. According to a new book, Brown\\'s Britain by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.\\n\\nIn an interview with BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said: \"I\\'ve dealt with this six months ago. I said then you don\\'t do deals over jobs like this - you don\\'t. \"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\"\\n\\nIn a separate interview with BBC political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Brown said: \"It\\'s very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a Labour government. \"I think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that I have. \"That is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day I seek to do. And I am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is Tony Blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. \"The only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country.\" Mr Brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on Saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.\\n\\nBut Mr Peston said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other and that Mr Blair had decided in November 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters\\' trust because of the Iraq war. He then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book. Andrew Marr said: \"This is enormously damaging. Gordon Brown knows it as well as Tony Blair. \"I think the relationship is genuinely, privately, very poor indeed. Things are very difficult.\" He added: \"Lots of ministers believe Tony Blair will attempt to move Gordon Brown out of the Treasury after the election. \"That depends on whether there\\'s still a Labour government and their majority.\"\\n\\nSenior MPs are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of Labour backbenchers on Monday.\\n\\nHealth Secretary John Reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging Labour\\'s re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven. Fresh speculation of a rift recently followed Mr Blair and Mr Brown\\'s separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair\\'s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other\\'s response to the disaster. But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\". Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of\"squabbling like schoolboys\". Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor said the personal ambition of Mr Blair and Mr Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\".\\n',\n",

Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. The investigation could take up to 18 months. However, Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot said he wanted it to be carried out as swiftly as possible. \"The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan,\" said Mr Barot. \"We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. I would like our analysis to be completed swiftly.\"\\n\\nThe matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission\\'s attention by eight of Alitalia\\'s rivals, including Germany\\'s Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain\\'s Iberia. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. Alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. It plans to split into AZ Fly and AZ Services, which will handle air and ground services respectively. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. EU rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the \"one time, last time\" rule for airlines. Otherwise, EU regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. The airline declined to comment on the Commission decision.\\n',\n",
       " 'Musicians \\'upbeat\\' about the net\\n\\nMusicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.\\n\\nThe study by US researchers, Pew Internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file-sharing. While most considered file-sharing as illegal, many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders. \"Even successful artists don\\'t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians,\" said report author Mary Madden.\\n\\nFor part of the study, Pew Internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between March and April 2004.\\n\\nThey ranged from full-time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. \"We looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry,\" Ms Madden told the BBC News website. \"We always hear the views of successful artists like the Britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented.\" The survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet, rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood. Almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration, with nine out of 10 going online to promote, advertise and post their music on the web. More than 80% offered free samples online, while two-thirds sold their music via the net. Independent musicians, in particular, saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly. \"Musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically,\" said Ms Madden. \"They are using the internet to gain inspiration, sell it online, tracking royalties, learning about copyright.\"\\n\\nPerhaps surprisingly, opinions about online file-sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.\\n\\nThrough the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music. But the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the US. It found that most artists saw file-sharing as both good and bad, though most agreed that it should be illegal. \"Free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing,\" said one musician quoted by the report. \"It\\'s hard to keep making records if they don\\'t pay for themselves through sales.\" However 60% said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters. Many suggested that rather than fighting file-sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it. \"Both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy,\" said Ms Madden.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mandelson warning to BBC\\n\\nThe BBC should steer away from \"demonising\" ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson has said.\\n\\nThe European commissioner and former Labour minister was speaking amid claims that Mr Campbell is part of a Labour \"dirty tricks\" campaign. That charge was denied by Mr Mandelson, who said the Tories were afraid of Mr Campbell\\'s campaigning skills. He warned the BBC that attacking Mr Campbell had brought it trouble before. That was a reference to the Hutton inquiry following a BBC story claiming Downing Street \"sexed up\" Iraq\\'s weapons of mass destruction dossier.\\n\\nThe affair prompted the resignation of BBC chairman Gavyn Davies, director-general Greg Dyke and reporter Andrew Gilligan. Labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about Tory leader Michael Howard\\'s past.\\n\\nMr Mandelson, a former Labour communications director, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"I understand why the Tories will be gunning for Alastair Campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. \"What I understand less is why the BBC should be joining with the Tories in driving that agenda. \"In my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. \"I suggest the BBC concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. \"I think the BBC would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as I say, not resume their demonisation of Alastair Campbell - we all know where that led before.\"\\n\\nMr Campbell is acting as an adviser for Labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox said Mr Campbell\\'s return and Labour poster plans attacking Mr Howard - recently withdrawn from the party\\'s website - were a sign of \"abusive politics\". \"The government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,\" he said on Sunday. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who is chairing the Power Inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. \"This feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,\" she said.\\n',\n",

       " 'Mobiles get set for visual radio\\n\\nThe growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing, but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked. Games, cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that won\\'t just see a change in our mobile phone habits - it might alter the way we listen to the radio. Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. It is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested - the early days of DAB Digital Radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day.\\n\\nOne problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. He said: \"I\\'m very happy to say it\\'s not television, what we\\'re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today. \"If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don\\'t know, or there\\'s a competition or vote that you\\'d like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you\\'ve just been listening to.\"\\n\\nThat visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to. As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television\\'s \"red button\" content.\\n\\nPossible interactive content includes competitions, votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing. But the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real-time basis. This in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue, as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners.\\n\\nAs the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network. And there will be a cost for the service as well, although it may depend on your usage. \"If you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it\\'ll be two or three pounds per month,\" said Mr Wasenius. \"But typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an \\'all you can eat\\' arrangement per month.\" The payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial-up connections. One thing that is for sure - assuming that Nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million Visual Radio-enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006. \"Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before.\"\\n\\nThe first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners. Station manager Steve Taylor commented: \"Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way. \"Not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like; mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets.\" Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.\\n\\nListen again to the interview on the Radio Five Live website.\\n',\n",

The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group, whose purpose is to promote free trade. Joining, however, is a lengthy process. China\\'s admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia and Saudi Arabia have been taking place for 10 years. Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country\\'s goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.\\n\\nIraq\\'s Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as November\\'s decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the country\\'s debts. Assad Omar, Afghanistan\\'s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, said accession would contribute to \"regional prosperity and global security\". There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO.

Senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. Customers\\' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any \"unusual activity\" was detected, bank officials said.\\n\\nBank of America said the tapes went missing in December while being shipped to a back-up data centre. \"We, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost,\" Alexandra Tower, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina-based bank, told Time magazine.

New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. \"Whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions,\" the Democrat senator said.

       " 'Councils prepare to set tax rises\\n\\nCouncil tax in Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.\\n\\nAuthorities will decide final figures on Thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation, which is currently 1.6%. The finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased. They say much additional government money is for new initiatives. Scottish Finance Minister, Tom McCabe MSP, said: \"Last week in parliament I announced an additional Â£419m for core expenditure to local government in Scotland. \"That\\'s a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.\" Mr McCabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years. He told BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Sunday Live programme: \"Here in Scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems.\\n\\n\"We think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services.\" The councils\\' umbrella organisation Cosla, which provided BBC Scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. Mr McCabe has promised them about Â£8.1bn next year. \"However, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services,\" a Cosla spokesman said. Cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services. They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending. The Conservatives accuse the Scottish Executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax.\\n\\nThe Tory finance spokesman, Brian Monteith MSP, said: \"Its a form of disguise... yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs. \"Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what we\\'ve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill.\" There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced. Linda Knox, Director of the Scottish Local Authority Management Centre at Strathclyde University, said: \"With this current settlement the increase is slowing. At the same time, the burdens on councils are greater than they were. \"The settlement figures don\\'t include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure - in the area of Â£325m - in efficiency savings across the settlement period.\" Education will be protected from any cuts but Linda Knox says this will mean other services will suffer. She said: \"In practice, that will mean a 4-5% cut for other services. On the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9.7% but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1% in real terms.\"\\n',\n",

Ulster had led 20-6 with tries from Paul Steinmetz and Bryn Cunningham. But the Irish province failed to add to the tally in the second half and ended up relieved to get the win to lift them to eighth place in the table. Borders had edged ahead with a sixth-minute penalty by Charlie Hore - only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try. Calum MacRae surrendered possession before centre Steinmetz sent a chip into the danger zone. Substitute Joe Pattison - who had come on for the injured Gareth Morton - wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.\\n\\nThe speedy Steinmetz had other ideas and he raced up to get the vital touch in the nick of time, giving Adam Larkin an easy conversion. Ally Warnock clawed back three points for Borders, but they were soon hit by another double-blow. First, Mark Blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full-back Cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper Andy Ward. Larkin again added the extras. Even worse was to come for Borders when Larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to Kelly Brown being sin-binned. The hosts gave themselves a glimmer of hope immediately after the restart, however, when Warnock struck a penalty at the other end. And he repeated the feat to set up the tense finale. Ulster coach mark McCall said he was delighted to get the victory. \"Borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time,\" said McCall. \"In the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.\"\\n\\nMorton, Moffat, MacRae, Hore, Berthinussen, Warnock, Moore, Thomson, Ford, Douglas, Blair, Stewart, Gray, Brown, McEntee.\\n\\nKay, Parr, McGee, Rennick, Weston, Millar, Pattison.\\n\\nCunningham, Maxwell, Bell, Steinmetz, Howe, Larkin, Campbell, S.

It was also committed to \"stamping out\" age discrimination and would outlaw it, he told a conference on ageing. All three parties have been wooing older voters with both the Tories and Lib Dems pledging higher pensions.\\n\\nMr Johnson told Age Concern\\'s Age Agenda in London the government was \"seriously considering\" introducing pensions based on residency rather than national insurance contributions. This idea has been adopted by the Lib Dems as policy, while the Tories have pledged to boost pensions by restoring the link between earnings and pensions. Mr Johnson\\'s speech comes after he last week unveiled plans to find a consensus on how to reform the country\\'s pension system. This would be based on a series of principles including tackling pensioner poverty and fairer pensions for women, he said. Speaking at the London conference he said: \"Generalised stereotypes of people past state pension age as dependant, incapable and vulnerable are a particularly pernicious form of age discrimination\".\\n\\nThe government wanted to tackle this by moving to a culture where retirement ages were \"increasingly consigned to the past\". \"We\\'re sweeping them away entirely for people under 65, and we\\'re giving those above that age a right to request to work past 65 which their employers will have to engage with seriously. \"And the review in 2011, which will look at whether it is time to sweep retirement ages away entirely, is to be tied to evidence ... showing that retirement ages are increasingly outmoded\".

Another Hollywood star is being lined up to co-star, while the rest of the cast will be Indian. Aishwarya Rai, star of Bride and Prejudice, is the \"preferred choice\" of the Indian studio involved in the film.\\n\\nOn a visit to India, the 60-year-old actor said he hoped to start shooting Racing The Monsoon next year. Douglas added that it had been inspired by a Wall Street Journal article about India\\'s \\'angadias\\', who courier money and diamonds around India.\\n\\nThe actor\\'s own production company, Further Films, is working in partnership with two Indian film-making concerns to bring the picture to the screen. Shailendra Singh, the founder of India\\'s Percept Films, said there would be \"a lot of India\" in the movie - and that an Indian train would play a big role. \"The train will be a crucial part of the film. The chase and most of the stunts will be on the train,\" said Mr Singh.

       " 'Tories \\'would cut number of MPs\\'\\n\\nThe Conservative Party would cut the number of MPs by about one-fifth if they were elected, Tory leader Michael Howard has said.\\n\\nThe plan forms part of the party\\'s \"smaller government bill\", to be unveiled later this week. Mr Howard told the Sunday Times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. And he said a referendum would be held in Wales to decide whether or not to scrap the Welsh Assembly.\\n\\nThe changes would all take place within five years of the Conservatives winning a general election, Mr Howard told the paper.\\n\\nThe precise number of MPs to go would depend on the result of the Welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. If Wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more MPs. Mr Howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by more than 80,000 and the Tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. \"It is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, Parliament and special advisers?\" he said. Shadow leader of the Commons Oliver Heald said: \"This will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people\\'s lives by reducing the size and role of the State\".\\n\\nMr Howard said the plan would also even out the \"great unfairness\" of there being proportionately more Scottish and Welsh MPs at Westminster than those from England. The average size of an English constituency was 70,000 people, Mr Howard said. In Northern Ireland it was just over 66,000, in Wales just over 59,000 and in Scotland 53,000. The number of Welsh MPs would be set at an amount that was \"consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the United Kingdom\" if the assembly was scrapped. Mr Howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. \"You have got to have a big bang. We don\\'t want this like the House of Lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.\"\\n',\n",

However they said that Busted would \"reconvene in due course\". The band have had eight top three hits, including four number ones, since they first hit the charts in 2002. Their singles include What I Go To School For, Year 3000, Crashed The Wedding, You Said No, and Who\\'s David?\\n\\nThe band, which also includes members Matt Jay and James Bourne, made the top ten with their self-titled debut album, as well as the follow-up, A Present For Everyone, in 2003. They won best pop act and best breakthrough act at the 2004 Brit Awards and were nominated for best British group. Most recently they topped the charts with the theme from the live-action film version of Thunderbirds, which was voted Record Of The Year on the ITV1 show. The band have capitalised on a craze for artists playing catchy pop music with rock overtones. The trio are seen as an alternative to more manufactured artists who are not considered credible musicians because they do not write their own songs or play their own instruments. However, recent rumours have suggested that Simpson has been wanting to quit the band to focus on Fightstar. He now plans to take Fightstar on tour.\\n',\n",

Three boys will rotate the demanding role of ballet dancer Billy, which requires them to sing, dance and act. The show\\'s opening night on 12 May at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London remains unaffected by the changes. Preview performances will now be held on 14, 20 and 27 April. \"This is one of the most ambitious projects I have been involved with,\" said Daldry. \"The decision has been made to push back our preview performances in order to give our company, with a cast including 45 children, a little extra time so they are as fully prepared as possible.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"The young Billy Elliots in particular, making their professional stage debuts in the West End, will benefit from a little extra time to familiarise themselves with all aspects of the production.\"\\n\\nThe three boys playing Billy are James Lomas, 15, George Maguire, 14, and Liam Mower, 12. The other major child parts will also be rotated between young actors. Such are the demands of the show that producers set up a stage school in Newcastle to train potential stars for the show. Child labour laws also mean the young actors can only work for a limited period each week. Adult actors in the show include Tim Healy as Billy\\'s father and Haydn Gwnne as his dance teacher Mrs Wilkinson. Sir Elton John has composed the music.

Mr Blair\\'s government was a \"bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals,\" he added. But Labour\\'s campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp responded: \"Britain is working, don\\'t let the Tories wreck it again\". Mr Howard also paid tribute to the nation\\'s character for its generous response to the Asian quake disaster. The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.\\n\\n\"We watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief. The scale, the speed, the ferocity of what happened on Boxing Day is difficult to grasp. \"Yet Britain\\'s response has shone a light on our nation\\'s character. The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever.\" He went on to reflect on the values that \"most Britons hold dear\". Looking ahead to the coming general election, he pledged to \"turn these beliefs into reality\" and set out the choices he says are facing Britain. \"How much tax do people want to pay? Who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want? \"Who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system?\"\\n\\nMr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the \"wrong solution\" to them.\\n\\n\"The result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives, undermining enterprise and denying people choice. \"Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people\\'s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.\" The Tories, he said, can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes. \"We can have progress without losing what makes Britain great - its tolerance, the respect for the rule of law, the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential. \"We simply need to change direction. The election will give Britain the chance to change.\" This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.\\n\\nBut Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: \"It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January.\" \"Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. \"With Labour Britain is working.

Discussions have begun with Indonesia on the exact timing and location of the deployment, but the government said the offer was aimed at the Aceh province. Downing St said a similar offer might be made to the Sri Lankan government.\\n\\nHowever a spokesman pointed out that there were particular logistical difficulties in Indonesia which the Gurkhas might be able to help with. The spokesman said: \"Following this morning\\'s daily coordination meeting on the post-tsunami relief effort, the government has formally offered the Indonesian government the assistance of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles around 120 personnel and two helicopters. \"This is in addition to the ships and aircraft we have already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean.\"\\n\\nIndonesia was by far the country worst affected by the tsunami, with 94,000 of the 140,000 confirmed deaths so far. International Development Minister Gareth Thomas said the assistance offer would most likely focus on the northern province of Aceh. \"We have offered the Gurkhas to help in the process of scaling up the relief effort, particularly in Aceh which is undoubtedly the hardest hit area in the Indian Ocean at the moment,\" he said. \"We\\'ve also had RAF aircraft flying in equipment which the UN desperately need in order to set up a truly effective relief operation on the ground in Aceh province as well.\" The offer comes as the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw arrives in Indonesia for a special summit meeting on the disaster.\\n',\n",
       " 'Iraqis win death test case probe\\n\\nThe family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government\\'s refusal to order a full inquiry.\\n\\nThe High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa\\'s death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights. And the judges paved the way for an independent inquiry by saying previous investigations were inadequate. But judicial reviews into five other deaths in southern Iraq were ruled out. Their families will be appealing against the judgement.\\n\\nThe families\\' solicitor Phil Shiner described it as \"a historic day for human rights and the rule of law in the UK\". Father-of-two Mr Mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in Basra in September 2003. He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen\\'s Lancashire Regiment. The Iraqi families\\' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.\\n\\nMinistry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction. But Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that UK jurisdiction could extend to a UK-run prison, but did not apply \"to the total territory of another state\". They said as Mr Mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the UK\\'s jurisdiction. The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.\\n\\nAnd it was difficult to say that the investigation which had already occurred \"has been timely, open or effective\", the judges said. After the ruling Carla Ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation Redress, said: \"It is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. \"There must be an effective public investigation by an independent official body. Only such an investigation could reveal what really happened and who might be responsible.\" Other allegations involving British soldiers included the shooting of an Iraqi police commissioner and the shooting of four Iraqi civilians in May 2003. Both sides were granted permission to appeal.\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair\\'s official spokesman said: \"Obviously we will need to study this detailed judgment. I would point out, however, that a separate criminal case is currently being considered by the army prosecuting authority. \"I can\\'t say anything further for obvious reasons. The MoD are considering whether to appeal.\" But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: \\'If there\\'s a case to answer, let\\'s have it out. Because we don\\'t want people thinking that British soldiers beat up civilians and get away with it\\',\" he said. \"The Ministry of Defence does everything in its power to try to prove we act ethically and properly under the rules of war.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Indian oil firm eyes Yukos assets\\n\\nIndia\\'s biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos.\\n\\n\"We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,\" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos\\' former key oil production unit for $2bn (Â£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.\\n\\nIt was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.\\n\\nState-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC\\'s plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin\\'s recent visit to New Delhi. \"It would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said Mr Aiyar. India\\'s oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India\\'s economy is booming and the country\\'s thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.\\n\\nIndia produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\\n\\n\"For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. \"We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,\" Mr Westwood said. \"By 2020, production may only be at half of today\\'s levels.\" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia\\'s Siberian coast.\\n\\nONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk.\\n\\nChinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC\\'s interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world\\'s biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin\\'s clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos\\' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\\n',\n",

They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally.\\n\\nPlasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. The display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of Sony and Samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (LCDs).

I\\'d gladly take it if it was offered to me.\"\\n\\nThe 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge. \"Andy would be a hard act to follow but it\\'s something I\\'m confident of being up to,\" he said. \"The GB team isn\\'t a one-man team. There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.\"\\n\\nSculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union. \"It\\'s a short career and you have to make of it what you can,\" said Sculthorpe. \"Nobody can blame him if he does go - he\\'s done everything in the game of rugby league.\\n\\n\"Financially it could set him up for life.

Sean Long, Sculthorpe\\'s Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future \"I think Sean\\'s situation is to do with the sheer number of games we\\'re playing,\" he said.\\n\\n\"The way he\\'s looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he\\'s willing to do that. \"The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures.

About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and runs from 6 to 9 January. The latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days.\\n\\nMr Gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content.\\n\\n\"We predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted - but there was a lot of work to do. \"What is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done. It is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it.\" He highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices \"seamless\". \"Gaming is becoming more of a social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications. \"And if we look at what has been going on with e-mail, instant messaging, blogging, entertainment - if we can make this seamless, we can create something quite phenomenal.\"\\n\\nMr Gates said the PC, like Microsoft\\'s Media Centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device. \"It is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference,\" he said. He also cited the success of the Microsoft Xbox video game Halo 2, released in November, which pushed Xbox console sales past PlayStation in the last two months of 2004 for the first time in 2004. The game, which makes use of the Xbox Live online games service, has sold 6.23 million copies since its release. \"People are online and playing together and that really points to the future,\" he said. Several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during Mr Gates\\' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements. Although most of these affected largely US consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come. These included what Mr Gates called an \"ecosystem of technologies\", like SBC\\'s IPTV, a high-definition TV and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast TV. There were also other deals announced which meant that people could watch and control content over portable devices and mobile phones.\\n\\nCES features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as Intel and Hewlett Packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music. About 50,000 new products will be unleashed at the tech-fest, which is the largest yet.

The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. That trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005.\\n',\n",
       " 'MPs criticise child access system\\n\\nDivorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, MPs have said.\\n\\nThe Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access. Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said. But they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access.\\n\\nCurrently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount. \"An arbitrary \\'template\\' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,\" the MPs said.\\n\\nThey said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases. This would \"reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety\", they said. Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed \"a new \\'status quo\\' arrangement for the children to become established by default\", they said.\\n\\n\"Although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias, there are considerable grounds for accepting that non-resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present. \"Given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases, we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents.\" Committee chairman Alan Beith said the five-month inquiry had been a \"complex and emotive\" one. \"At the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation,\" he said. \"This situation has to change. The court system should only be used as a last resort, where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with. \"This will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country.\"\\n',\n",

Her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an Oscar nomination. She said: \"Never in a million years did I think this was going to happen. \"Being here and just being nominated is great, but I hope it means more people will go and see the film as well.\" Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator.\\n\\nShivering in a floor-length shimmering Armani dress, the Australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: \"It\\'s tight but I love it.\" Glamour was also brought to the evening by actress Sienna Miller, supermodel Claudia Schiffer - who was supporting her director husband Matthew Vaughn - Troy actress Diane Kruger and star of the TV programme The OC, Micha Barton. Wearing a caramel-coloured floaty frock by the designer Alexander McQueen, Miller told reporters the red carpet experience was \"intense, nerve-wracking and cold\". The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films.

Keanu Reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an \"exciting\" part of his job. \"It is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,\" he said. Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him. He said: \"I am a great admirer of British cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.\\n\\n\"They give me a new energy when I see the best coming out of England and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. \"To recognise me in this way is a great honour.\" British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it \"meant a lot\" to be at the ceremony.

It was Mirza\\'s sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month. Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed Alicia Molik. Mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against Kuznetsova.\\n\\nShe quickly slipped 4-0 down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large Indian contingent in the crowd. \"I really didn\\'t expect that after my ankle turn,\" said Mirza. \"I played a great match and I think (the crowd) did it again. I knew that I had to play an all-round game and that\\'s what happened. \"I did everything well but I wasn\\'t missing the ball - I don\\'t know how that happened.\" Mirza plays Silvia Farina Elia or Jelena Jankovic next. Hantuchova has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22, having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events. \"It was such a tough first-round match and I am glad to come through,\" said Hantuchova. \"She was serving so well. I just decided to hang in there and keep fighting.\" The Slovakian will meet Elena Likhovtseva in the second round after the Russian struggled past Tunisian wild card Selima Sfar 2-6 6-2 7-6.

He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\\n\\nLabour\\'s election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"\\n',\n",

Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.\\n\\nAt the heart of the administration\\'s fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.\\n\\nSuch belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush\\'s first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was \"fair and responsible\". \"It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,\" he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.\\n\\nEducation, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.\\n\\nMost controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation\\'s poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush\\'s proposals would see the Pentagon\\'s budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.\\n\\nThe budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.\\n\\nAlso not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration\\'s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.\\n\\nJohn McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. \"With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,\" he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. \"The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. It was also hit by troubles at its US catering business. Last year, Lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some European and US airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend.

Details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. Labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. A year ago, ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and Thursday\\'s figures offer a progress check. They will say that in the past year more than 2,600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.\\n\\nPolice have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders, breaking up groups of youths in public places. The 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. Exeter and Cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of Asbos and fixed penalty notices. There are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.\\n\\nHe is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed. \"We have not defeated this problem by any means, but shown together what can be done,\" he will say. Mr Blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws, saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.\\n\\nMinisters also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25,000 community support officers (CSOs). But researchers from Leeds University warned that CSOs could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. More work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before CSOs, they argued in a the study. Critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. Home Office Minister Hazel Blears also revealed this week that \"about a third\" of Asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.\\n',\n",

European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen\\'s boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester\\'s overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told.

Yukos\\' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft\\'s purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group\\'s managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: \"If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.\"\\n\\nRosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.

The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (Â£130,000) fine.\\n\\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.\\n',\n",

Internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of China's plans for developing its economy, analysts said. Beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down.\\n\\nChinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. Still, recent rulings and announcements will have boosted optimism that attitudes are changing. Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. And on Tuesday, Paws Incorporated - the owner of the rights to Garfield the cat - won a court battle against a publishing house that violated its copyright. Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota.\\n\\nThe problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge. The European Union estimates that the global trade in pirated wares is worth more than 200bn euros a year (Â£140bn; $258bn), or about 5% of total world trade. And it is growing. Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said. Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods. Other countries on the EU's hit list include Thailand, Brazil, South Korea and Indonesia. Any countries that are not making enough of an effort could be dragged to the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a step that could trigger economic sanctions, the EU warned.\\n\",\n",
       " 'EU China arms ban \\'to be lifted\\'\\n\\nThe EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.\\n\\nThe 15-year-old ban was imposed in the aftermath of China\\'s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw told a Commons select committee human rights concerns over China remained. But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.\\n\\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. The EU\\'s move was welcomed at the time by Beijing, which described the embargo as a \"product of the Cold War\". German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious on the issue, but on Wednesday Mr Straw said he also wanted it to end. \"I have long understood China\\'s argument, that to lump them in with, say, Burma and Zimbabwe is not appropriate and I don\\'t think it is,\" he told the joint committee on Strategic Export Controls. He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July. But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country. \"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"\\n\\nMr Straw said the US government was suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted. But he said many of Washington\\'s objections were based on a \"lack of information and understanding\" of how export control guidelines worked in EU countries. And \"intense discussions\" were taking place with US officials to convince them it was the right thing to do. Washington is thought to fear it would lead to a buying spree for arms that could be used by China to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses. US Undersecretary of State John Bolton is meeting British officials this week to press the case for keeping the embargo.\\n',\n",

Buhecha, who made Â£26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\\n\\nAn operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\\n\\nIn December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films. The organisation\\'s anti-piracy director David Martin said: \"The problem simply will not disappear with Buhecha. Others and more will take his place, so it\\'s vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Kennedy questions trust of Blair\\n\\nLib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a \"fundamental lack of trust\" of Tony Blair as prime minister.\\n\\nHe said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems \"what you see is what you get\". He made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on Channel Five in a session on The Wright Stuff programme. Questions from callers, a studio audience and the show\\'s presenter covered Lib Dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.\\n\\nMr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics. \"1983 was when I was first elected as an MP - so Tony Blair, Michael Howard and myself were all class of \\'83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,\" he said. \"We don\\'t actually hear the argument any longer: \\'Lib Dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it\\'s a wasted vote\\'. \"You don\\'t hear that because the evidence of people\\'s senses demonstrates that it isn\\'t a wasted vote.\" But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people. \"There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What we\\'ve got to do as a party - what I\\'ve got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get.\" Mr Kennedy also used his TV appearance to defend his party\\'s plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than Â£100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. He said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cebit fever takes over Hanover\\n\\nThousands of products and tens of thousands of visitors make Cebit the place to be for technology lovers.\\n\\n\"Welcome to CeBit 2005\" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. Hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists. CeBit itself is huge, the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right.\\n\\nThere are restaurants, shops, and a bus service between the halls - of which there are 27. There are more than 6,000 companies here, showing their latest products. The list of them that I was given when I came in is the size and weight of a phone book. One of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence.\\n\\nThe \"entertainment PC\" is being billed as the replacement for DVD players, stereos, telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house. To show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype \"digital lifestyle home\" by German magazine Computer Reseller News. \"We wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes,\" said Claudia Neulling from the magazine. The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room.\\n\\nThat PC provides home entertainment, movies or music. It can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a DVD player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. \"Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,\" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. \"The real challenge is to show people it\\'s easier than they think, and fun.\"\\n\\nHe firmly believes that entertainment PCs are the future, but says they have to get past people\\'s fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. That is something Microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running Windows XP Media Centre edition 2005 for people to try out. Mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. Samsung is showing off its SGH-i300, a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive, that can be used to watch compressed video or as an MP3 player. And if you would rather watch live TV than a downloaded movie NEC is showing a phone, on sale in China, which can show analogue TV on its colour screen.\\n\\n\"I think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example\" said Koji Umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for NEC. He admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move, and they do not have plans to launch it in Europe at the moment. Nokia was happy to demonstrate its 6230i, an upgrade to the very popular 6230.\\n\\nIt now has a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a music player that can handle multiple formats, rather than just MP3s. It is also compatible with Nokia\\'s new Visual Radio technology. The handset can receive FM broadcasts, and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a GPRS connection, to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market.\\n\\nPortable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. \"The benefits over conventional Bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life,\" said Riccardo de Rinaldini, Creative\\'s European marketing manager. The firm has a prototype headset linked up to a Zen Micro player. The transmitter on the player creates a private, magnetic \"bubble\" around the user, which is picked up by the headset. The range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. A single AAA battery is said to last up to 30 hours. Creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. Even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. Adidas has a trainer which, according to Susanne Risse from the company, can \"sense, understand, and adapt to your running style\". It has a battery, processor, and motor embedded in the sole. Buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly. It is being billed as \"the world\\'s first intelligent shoe\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Pension hitch for long-living men\\n\\nMale life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated, leading pension researchers have said.\\n\\nThe Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. But if measured at age 65 instead, the PPI said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. The PPI\\'s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.\\n\\nThe government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. Chris Curry, PPI research director, said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged. \"Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age,\" he said. Researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women, who on average live longer than men.\\n',\n",

The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox. But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson, who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for Â£6.5m. On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of Â£4m.\\n\\nBlackburn have said all along that they want Â£6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal. Williams said: \"We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement.\" The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts. Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking \"unlikely\" before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. \"We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers,\" he added. \"The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to. \"The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment.\" It is understood that Blackburn accepted a Â£5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend. But the player is determined to return to Scotland and rejected a move to Goodison Park. Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an \"emotional and difficult time\" for the player.\\n',\n",

The package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy.\\n\\nThe Mac mini is just a box. If you don\\'t already have a monitor etc, adding them to the package sees the value for money begin to dwindle. Macs don\\'t offer the upgrade flexibility of a PC and the machine\\'s specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high-end video editing or games.\\n\\n\"The Mac Mini puts the Macintosh within the reach of everyone,\" an Apple spokesman said. \"It will bring more customers to the platform, especially PC users and owners.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAn entry-level machine designed for basic home use.\\n\\nA 2.6ghz Intel Celeron chip, 40 gigabyte hard drive, 256mb, combined CD burner/DVD player.

The good news is that the machine is eminently expandable. By contrast, says Mr Cox, the Mac mini is almost disposable.\\n',\n",
       " 'Child access laws shake-up\\n\\nParents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers\\' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC \"there is a recognition that something is wrong\". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.\\n\\nLord Falconer told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:\\n\\n\\n - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past \\n - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases \\n - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet \\n - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. \\n \\n\\nJudges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child\\'s interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a \"medium range\" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.\\n\\nFailure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: \"Tagging may be going too far, but let\\'s have a debate about that.\" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published \"in the next two weeks,\" a spokesman said.\\n\\nThe government\\'s proposals have met with disapproval from fathers\\' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.\" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".\\n\\n\"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. \"Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart.\" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children\\'s Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.\\n\\nThe Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that the government\\'s plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\". She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\". \"We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,\" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up \"like property\" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having \"rigid targets\".\\n',\n",

       " 'Consumer concern over RFID tags\\n\\nConsumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.\\n\\nMore than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\\n\\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini\\'s principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. \"Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. \"With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point.\" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Strong dollar\\' call halts slide\\n\\nThe US dollar\\'s slide against the euro and yen has halted after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was \"in America\\'s interest\".\\n\\nBut analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush\\'s administration had done little to stop the dollar\\'s slide. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. The dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100GMT, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 November. Against the Japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.\\n\\nPolicy makers in Europe have called the dollar\\'s slide \"brutal\" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. However, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro\\'s rise at a monthly meeting of Eurozone ministers late on Monday. Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Mr Snow who is currently in Dublin at the start of a four-nation EU visit, has applauded Ireland\\'s introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. \"The eurozone is growing below its potential. When a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,\" he said. Mr Snow\\'s comments may have helped shore up the dollar on Monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.\\n\\n\"Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,\" he explained. \"Markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals.\" US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. Domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by President Bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (Â£230bn). The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. For many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. \"No end is in sight,\" said Carsten Fritsch, a strategist at Commerzbank . \"It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30.\" Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy.\\n',\n",

He was part of a 19-strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists. Five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign.\\n\\nMr MacDonald told BBC News: \"The reason why I am resigning is because I fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion. \"The current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the Muslim community in Britain and the whole Asian community. \"I think it is giving Britain a bad name internationally\".\\n\\nUnder the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 September attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. But Mr MacDonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury. \"My own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury, a proper criminal trial with proper accusations. \"As far as I\\'m concerned, the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this.\" he added.\\n\\nThe Attorney General Lord Goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from Mr MacDonald on Monday. According to the Independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers - Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Nicol QC, Manjit Singh Gill QC, Rick Scannell and Tom de la Mare. They are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of Special Advocates who represent detainees before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. Mr MacDonald said he had \"no idea\" whether further resignations would follow. But Barry Hugill, a spokesman for the campaign group Liberty, told Radio 4\\'s Today programme that more lawyers may go. \"I can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning,\" he said. \"They are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.\"\\n\\nHelena Kennedy, a Labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the Special Advocates\\' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. \"When this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 September there was a great deal of argument particularly in the House of Lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review,\" she said. \"Without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as Ian McDonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'World tour for top video gamers\\n\\nTwo UK gamers are about to embark on a world tour as part of the most lucrative-ever global games tournament.\\n\\nAaron Foster and David Treacy have won the right to take part in a tournament offering $1m in total prize money. The cash will be handed out over 10 separate competitions in a continent-hopping contest organised by the Cyberathlete Professional League. As part of their prize the pair will have their travel costs paid to ensure they can get to the different bouts.\\n\\nThe CPL World Tour kicks off in mid-February and the first leg will be in Istanbul. All ten bouts of the tournament will be played throughout 2005, each one in a different country. At each stop $50,000 in prize money will be up for grabs. The tournament champion for each leg of the CPL World Tour will walk away with a $15,000 prize. The winner of the grand final will get a prize purse of $150,000 from a total pot of $500,000.\\n\\nWinners of each stage of the tour automatically get a place at the next stop. The world tour stops are open to any keen gamer that registers. Online registration for the first stop opens this weekend. Some pro-players are winning a spot at the tour destinations through qualifying events organised by CPL partners. Winners at these qualifiers get seeded higher in the elimination parts of each tournament. Mr Foster and Mr Treacy get the chance to attend the World Tour as members of the UK\\'s Four-Kings gaming clan. Towards the end of 2004 Four-Kings staged a series of online Painkiller competitions to reveal the UK\\'s top players of the PC game. The best eight players met face-to-face in a special elimination event in late December where Mr Foster and Mr Tracey proved their prowess at Painkiller. As part of their prize the pair also get a contract with Four-Kings Intel which is one of the UK\\'s few pro-gaming teams. \"There are a lot of people who take gaming very seriously and support their local or national team with the same passion as any other sport,\" said Simon Bysshe who filmed the event for Four-Kings and Intel. More than 80,000 people have downloaded the movie of the tournament highlights. \"Professional gaming is here to stay and will only grow in popularity,\" he said.\\n',\n",

       " \"Security scares spark browser fix\\n\\nMicrosoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.\\n\\nThe revamp has been prompted by Microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer.\\n\\nThe announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. Although details were scant, Mr Gates, said IE7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. This last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.\\n\\nIn a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser. Microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. One of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program. An own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox. In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. According to market statistics gathered by Websidestory, Firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. However, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. Some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the Firefox browser. Internet Explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.\\n\",\n",

The Conservatives were in second place with donations totalling Â£4,610,849, while the Liberal Democrats received just over Â£1m. The majority of Labour's donations came from affiliated trade unions. There were also large sums from individuals. Lord Drayson, whose company PowderJect won multi-million pound contracts to provide smallpox vaccine to the government after the 11 September terror attacks, gave Â£500,000 to the party just days before Christmas.\\n\\nThis followed an earlier donation of the same amount earlier in 2004. He was made a lord by Tony Blair last year. Other significant donations came from retired millionaire businessman and philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje who gave the party a sum of Â£500,000, and refrigerator magnate William Haughey OBE who gave Â£330,000. The totals for the fourth quarter were well up on the same period of 2003, as the parties built up their war chests for the general election campaign. The largest donation to the Conservatives was a bequest from Ruth Beardmore of nearly Â£400,000. The joint founder of merchant bank Hambro Magan gave Â£325,417. There were also donations topping Â£250,000 for the Conservatives from Scottish Business Groups Focus on Scotland and the Institute of International Research, the world's largest independent conference company.\\n\\nAlso among the gifts to the Tories were 24 donations totalling Â£161,840 from Bearwood Corporate Services. This company is controlled by the party's former treasurer Lord Ashcroft which has directed almost Â£300,000 to specific marginal constituencies over the past two years. The Liberal Democrats' largest donor was the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Ltd, a company which promotes political reform and constitutional change, which gave a sum of Â£250,000. And fast food giants McDonald's are listed as donating a sum of Â£10,575. This was a fee the firm paid for a room for an event held with the work and skills foundation during the party's conference. The UK Independence Party, which lost its main donor Paul Sykes amid the row over Robert Kilroy-Silk's bid for the leadership last autumn, took in Â£63,081. Just Â£8,170 of this was cash and the remainder came in gifts in kind, such as office space and printing. Registered political parties are required to set out each quarter all donations over Â£5,000 to their headquarters and over Â£1,000 to local constituency parties they receive. It is an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false declaration about party donations.\\n\",\n",

Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. \"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward,\" said central bank governor Park Seung. \"The worst seems to have passed.\" Mr Park\\'s statement came as the bank decided to keep interest rates at an all-time low of 3.25%. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. Other indicators are also suggesting that the country is inching back towards economic health. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers\\' bad debts.

Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, the film opened on Wednesday, bringing its total takings to $21.6m (Â£11.4m). Top of the box office for a second week was action movie National Treasure. The family adventure, starring Nicolas Cage, took $33.1m (Â£17.m), ahead of animated comedy The Incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $24.1m (Â£12.7m).\\n\\nLast week Oliver Stone\\'s film met with scathing reviews from US critics. The film stars Irish actor Colin Farrell as one of history\\'s most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25. In particular, its portrayal of Alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from Greek lawyers. \"Though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from Oliver Stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity,\" wrote one reviewer in Rolling Stone magazine. Others poured scorn on Farrell\\'s bleached hair and Angelina Jolie\\'s unwieldy accent, which Variety called \"a combination of Mata Hari and Count Dracula\" . But novelist Gore Vidal defended the film, saying it was \"barrier-breaking\" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.\\n\\nIn Sweden last Thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the Stockholm International Film Festival, Stone expressed the hope that Alexander might be better appreciated in Europe. \"One of the reasons I am being honoured here is Europeans tend to see me a little differently than they do in the US,\" said the director behind JFK, Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July. He added Alexander \"was not an easy movie, but then I\\'ve never made easy movies\".\\n',\n",
       " 'UK gets official virus alert site\\n\\nA rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the UK government.\\n\\nThe service, IT Safe, will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. Alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. The service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. The scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. The government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year, based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. \"There is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work,\" said Home Office Minister Hazel Blears. \"The purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm.\" Those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.\\n\\nFull-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people Between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. \"IT Safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe,\" said Roger Cumming, director of the National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).\\n\\nThe NISCC, which is running the service, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure. Warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. Alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. This might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. However no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. The alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. The NISCC spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.\\n\\nGovernment statistics show that more than half of all UK households own a home computer. It was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. The launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. In September 2004, the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100,000 mark. Some fear that this figure could hit 150,000 by September 2005. The creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the Netherlands and US. The National Alerting Service for the Netherlands (aka De Waarschuwingsdienst) and the US National Cyber Alerting Service also tell citizens of serious security threats.\\n',\n",

According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile.\\n\\nThe Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found.\\n\\nThe move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house.\\n\\nMany of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the \"cosiness\" of making a call there. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey.\\n',\n",

They use \"pester power\" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said. As for how they spend their cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor said.\\n\\nDatamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.\\n\\nBritish teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as \"particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines\". And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.\\n',\n",

Mr Hain made the claim about Tory tactics in the anti-terror bill debate. \"Something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled,\" Mr Howard said. Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four\\'s Today programme that Mr Howard\\'s stance on the government\\'s anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk. He then accused the Tory Leader of behaving like an \"attack mongrel\" and \"playing opposition for opposition sake\".\\n\\nMr Howard told his party that Labour would \"do anything, say anything, claim anything to cling on to office at all costs\". \"So far this year they have compared me to Fagin, to Shylock and to a flying pig. This morning Peter Hain even called me a mongrel. \"I don\\'t know about you, but something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled.\" Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett rejected Mr Howard\\'s comment, telling Radio 4\\'s PM programme that Labour was not \"rattled\". \"We have a very real duty to try to get people to focus on Michael Howard\\'s record, what the proposals are that he is trying to put forward to the country and also the many examples we are seeing now of what we believe is really poor judgement on his behalf.\"\\n\\nMr Howard said Tory policies on schools, taxes, immigration and crime were striking a chord with voters.\\n\\n\"Since the beginning of this year - election year - we\\'ve been making the political weather,\" he told the party conference. Mr Howard denied he had been \"playing politics\" by raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago. And he hit back at Labour claims he had used Mrs Dixon as a \"human shield\". \"She\\'s not a human shield Mr Blair, she\\'s a human being.\" Mr Howard said his party plans for immigration quotas, which have also been the focus of much media coverage, were not \"racist\" - just \"common sense\".\\n\\nHe pledged cleaner hospitals and better school discipline, with a promise to get rid of \"political correctness\" in the national curriculum and give everyone to the same chance of a \"decent\" state education as he had. \"I come from an ordinary family. If the teenage Michael Howard were applying to Cambridge today, Gordon Brown would love me.\"\\n\\nAnd he stressed his party\\'s commitment to cut taxes and red tape and increase the basic state pension in line with earnings. He finished with a personal appeal to party activists to go out and win the next election. \"One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, \\'I was there. I did my bit. I played my part. I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better\\'.\" Labour election co-ordinator Alan Milburn said: \"Michael Howard\\'s speech today confirms what we have always said - that his only strategy is opportunism but he has no forward vision for the country. In reference to the appearance of Mr Howard\\'s family on the conference stage with him, Mr Milburn said: \"Michael Howard is perfectly entitled to pose with his family today. \"But it is the hard working families across Britain that will be damaged by his plan to cut Â£35bn from public spending.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Straw backs ending China embargo\\n\\nUK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union\\'s arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.\\n\\nMr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record. The EU imposed its arms ban on China in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in Tiananmen Square. Mr Straw also signed a deal on China-UK tourism. It is expected this would increase the number of Chinese tourists by 40,000 per year, providing $120m in revenue. China has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. Mr Straw, speaking at a joint news conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing, stressed this point. \"The result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from European Union member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,\" Mr Straw said. Earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.\\n\\nBut Mr Straw faces tough opposition to the move. Tory foreign affairs spokesman Michael Ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be \"irresponsible\" and would damage Britain\\'s relations with the US. He said Mr Straw was \"naive beyond belief\" if he accepted China\\'s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe.\" When he was in Tokyo earlier this week, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura told the British minister that his plan to remove the embargo was \" a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only Japan, but also East Asia overall\". Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan. Beijing says Taiwan is part of Chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary. The US is bound by law to help Taiwan defend itself. Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. It is an issue raised by human rights groups too. Brad Adams, from the UK\\'s Human Rights Watch, said: \"This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square.\" But Mr Straw insisted the EU\\'s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.\\n',\n",

They have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow Brit nominees such as Keane and Snow Patrol. \"British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,\" declared Kasabian\\'s singer Tom Meighan.\\n\\n\"No-one\\'s doing it at the minute. Music feels like it\\'s in the afterlife right now. We don\\'t want people to give up on it. \"The serpent\\'s going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!\" Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.\\n\\nThey enlisted guitarist and keyboard player Christopher Karloff after spotting him in a pub. \"We saw his long sideburns and thought \\'hey, he looks the part, we\\'ll ask him,\\'\" said Meighan. Inspired by Britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound. \"We got a computer and we cut rock\\'n\\'roll up, because there\\'s no point in going back to how it was,\" said Meighan. \"It\\'s all about new ideas and creativity.\"\\n\\nThe band\\'s original approach is reflected in its name, inspired by Linda Kasabian - the getaway driver of US serial killer Charles Manson. Coincidentally it is also the Armenian term for \"butcher\". Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively.\\n\\nThey built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both Glastonbury and T in the Park, and at a series of \"guerilla gigs\" at unusual venues including Half Time Orange, a pub next to Leicester City football club\\'s headquarters. Kasabian\\'s self-titled album was released last September to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Happy Mondays.\\n\\nRegarding it as \"both a fiery assertion of rock \\'n\\' roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of Rutland Water\", the NME\\'s praise was typical of the album\\'s reception. As 2004 progressed Kasabian would score a further two hits - Processed Beats and Cutt Off - and embark upon a well-received UK tour. \"We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,\" said Pizzorno. \"This is not a job to us,\" added Meighan. \"This is the best life we could ever have. This is what it\\'s all about and without it we\\'d be lost souls. But music needs us as well.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Germany calls for EU reform\\n\\nGerman Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU\\'s stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.\\n\\nMr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria. Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. Changes to the pact are due to be agreed at an economic summit in March.\\n\\nThe current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country\\'s deficit to 3% of GDP. Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. The European Commission acknowledged last month that it would not impose sanctions on countries who break the rules.\\n\\nMr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions. \"The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions,\" he wrote. \"Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU.\"\\n\\nDeficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several \"mandatory criteria\". These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering \"special economic burdens\". The proposed changes would make it harder for the European Commission to launch infringement action against any state which breaches the pact\\'s rules. Mr Schroeder\\'s intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday\\'s Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone\\'s rules.\\n',\n",
       " \"Housewives lift Channel 4 ratings\\n\\nThe debut of US television hit Desperate Housewives has helped lift Channel 4's January audience share by 12% compared to last year.\\n\\nOther successes such as Celebrity Big Brother and The Simpsons have enabled the broadcaster to surpass BBC2 for the first month since last July. However the channel's share of the audience fell from 11.2% to 9.6% last month in comparison with January 2004. Celebrity Big Brother attracted less viewers than its 2002 series.\\n\\nComedy drama Desperate Housewives managed to pull in five million viewers at one point during its run to date, attracting a quarter of the television audience. The two main television channels, BBC1 and ITV1, have both seen their monthly audience share decline in a year on year comparison for January, while Five's proportion remained the same at a slender 6.3%. Digital multi-channel TV is continuing to be the strongest area of growth, with the BBC reporting Freeview box ownership of five million, including one million sales in the last portion of 2004. Its share of the audience soared by 20% in January 2005 compared with last year, and currently stands at an average of 28.6%.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Boeing unveils new 777 aircraft\\n\\nUS aircraft firm Boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry\\'s leading manufacturer.\\n\\nThe 777-200LR will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as London and Sydney. Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.\\n\\nAnalysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between Boeing and Airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. Boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world\\'s airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.\\n\\nIt is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200LR and its much-anticipated 787 Dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. The 777-200LR, which had its launch delayed by the 11 September attacks in the US, is the fifth variation of Boeing\\'s twin-aisle 777 plane. The company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in Seattle at 2200 GMT. Better fuel efficiency from engines made by GE and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\\n\\n\"Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. But the 777-200LR \"is a niche player\", Mr Learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. Mr Learmount pointed out that the 777-200LR has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. He also said that while the plane may be able to fly to Sydney from London in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.\\n\\nFor Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. It has been producing a rival to Boeing\\'s 777 line for more than a year. \"Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said Flight International\\'s Mr Learmount.\\n\\nBoth Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. These orders should help underpin the company\\'s profits. Boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a US air force 767 tanker contract. Net profit was $186m (Â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.\\n',\n",
       " 'German business confidence slides\\n\\nGerman business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe\\'s largest economy.\\n\\nMunich-based research institute Ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in February from 97.5 in January, its first decline in three months. The study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. Observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.\\n\\n\"We\\'re surprised that the Ifo index has taken such a knock,\" said DZ bank economist Bernd Weidensteiner. \"The main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade.\" Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February\\'s Ifo confidence figure \"a very mild decline\". He said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected \"a modest economic upswing\" to continue.\\n\\nGermany\\'s economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making German products less competitive overseas. On top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including DaimlerChrysler, Siemens and Volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany\\'s continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.\\n',\n",

But an all-party committee said it was \"not confident\" many would be ready. It blamed the Department for Constitutional Affairs for a \"lack of consistent leadership\".\\n\\nThe Act comes into effect in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, on 1 January while similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions.\\n\\nBut the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an \"unusually high turnover\" of staff within the department, which had \"seriously interfered\" with its work, said the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee. It said, despite four years of preparations, some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready. The DCA had \"failed\" to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a \"lack of consistent leadership\", the MPs found. Committee chairman Alan Beith said: \"The DCA has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. \"Our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the DCA, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking.\" A spokesman for the DCA said: \"The DCA has provided - and will continue to provide - strong, clear leadership. \"It has delivered a simple, liberal fees regime, guidance on the Act which has been widely praised, and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation.\"\\n',\n",

The Aviator took five prizes including best supporting actress for Cate Blanchett. The biopic of Howard Hughes led the nominations with 11. Jamie Foxx picked up best actor for playing soul star Ray Charles in Ray. Many expected this to be Scorsese\\'s year - but he was unsuccessful in the best director category for the fifth time in his career.\\n\\nHe has never won despite being nominated for such films as Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead, Eastwood took his second Oscar for best director after winning for Unforgiven in 1993. \"It was a wonderful adventure,\" Eastwood said. \"To make a picture in 37 days, it takes a well oiled machine. I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working. I\\'ve got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton. \"I don\\'t know what I did in this life to deserve this,\" she told the audience. \"I\\'m just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\" Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor. He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you\\'re due - maybe you are, maybe you aren\\'t - it\\'s an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby\\'s success was the night\\'s biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\\n\\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film\\'s director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator\\'s other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody\\'s drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\\n\\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children\\'s shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp.

       " 'School sport \\'is back\\', says PM\\n\\nTony Blair has promised that \"sport is back\" as a priority for schools.\\n\\nThe prime minister launched a Â£500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in England to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. \"It\\'s an important part of education and it\\'s an important part of health,\" Mr Blair said. But the Conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours\\' PE within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.\\n\\nThe latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and Tai Chi being options. Launching the initiative, Mr Blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl Waverley Sports College in Southwark, south London. He said: \"You\\'ve got to bring back school sport. It\\'s got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. It\\'s still very, very important.\"\\n\\nEarlier, Education Secretary Charles Clarke told BBC News there were at least three areas which needed \"a coherent framework\" and \"dedicated funding\". These were training for PE teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. He added the government had originally pledged \"for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education\" a week. The proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. The money for the initiative will come from a new Â£500m fund.\\n\\nThe Â£500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. Shadow spokesman for sport Hugh Robertson said: \"I suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.\" He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an \"anti-competitive sport agenda\" had been pursued in recent years. Martin Ward, of the Secondary Heads Association, said members did not like \"ring-fenced funds\" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.\\n',\n",

The call came in a speech on improving the London insurance market.\\n\\n\"The FSA should not bide their time and \\'wait and see\\'. They should seize the moment,\" Mr Prettejohn, Lloyd\\'s chief executive said. The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. Last week, the City watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. Brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the FSA said.\\n\\nIn the US, lack of transparency about brokers\\' commissions has led to problems. The world\\'s biggest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan said last week it would pay $850m to settle charges, raised by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in October, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. The probe centred around so-called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers\\' customers. All of the insurance business written in the Lloyd\\'s market is placed via brokers.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ukraine strikes Turkmen gas deal\\n\\nUkraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by Turkmenistan.\\n\\nThe deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy. Supplies from Turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by Ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. Turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with Russia, which is not so dependent on its gas. Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov, who signed the contract, said the Turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $2 per 1,000 cubic metres, bringing it down to $58. But the new price is still $14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. The head of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftohaz company, Yury Boyko, said he was \"fully happy\" with the deal. On Friday, Turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to Ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. Mr Niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to Russia. Analysts say thay may not happen as Russia, the world\\'s leading gas producer, needs the cheap Turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned Gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in Siberia. Turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.\\n',\n",

       " 'Roundabout continues nostalgia trip\\n\\nThe new big-screen version of The Magic Roundabout, released in the UK on Friday, is the latest attempt to turn children\\'s television into box-office gold.\\n\\nRecent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show Thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of E Nesbit\\'s Five Children and It, previously filmed by the BBC in 1991. He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake\\'s Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung! in the US, replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s TV show with polished, computer-generated animation.\\n\\nIn a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original\\'s puppets and models. The films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song. But while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. \"This CG-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion Roundabout a cult hit,\" writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site.\\n\\nAnd the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors\\' outrage that Gerry Anderson\\'s Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children\\'s TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.\\n\\n\"I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. \"But I think it\\'s backfiring. What\\'s next - The Clangers on some distant planet, with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them?\" Despite Thunderbirds\\' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (Â£22m) but only recouped $21m (Â£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment.\\n\\nAfter the success of Garfield: The Movie, Britain\\'s shabby tabby\\n\\nsurely deserves his own film vehicle. With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ.\\n\\nFurry recyclers\\n\\nhave already had one big-screen outing - 1977\\'s Wombling Free. But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. Advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the BBC\\'s supernatural comedy\\n\\n. And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TV\\'s most popular cartoon buccaneer,\\n\\n. It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.\\n\\nThe Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow about bringing Catweazle to the big screen? He could give Gandalf a run for his money!\\n\\nThundercats!! I loved it. Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!\\n\\nGet your hands off the Clangers! Is nothing sacred?\\n\\nMake a movie version of the Banana splits!\\n\\nWhat about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.\\n\\nYou forgot to mention the grearest of them all, Danger Mouse! But then again, it couldn\\'t be better than the original series, could it?\\n\\nIt\\'s always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!) I think I\\'ve been completely put off. Just leave these classics alone as good memories.\\n\\nI think remakes are a good idea. As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. I believe this is the whole reason \"retro\" has become so popular. As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. Personally i\\'d like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.\\n\\nLeave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.\\n\\nLove to see Transformers with real actors and CGI. And make it at least a 15 rating.\\n\\nPart of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. Dougal never smiled like that! Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.\\n\\nI have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. It\\'s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.\\n\\nIt\\'s all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a \\'new\\' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?\\n\\nAll I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids\\' show ever. I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.\\n\\nThere WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original\\'s cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate. We live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it\\'s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.\\n\\nIt got to be Mr.Benn. The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. And who to play the lead role? Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin. If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character.\\n\\nMuffin the Mule perhaps ? After all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!\\n\\nWhy can\\'t the British film industry try making Gerry Anderson\\'s UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People.\\n\\nIn today\\'s media, it seems the past is the future. TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ\\'s are sampling or re-working 70\\'s and 80\\'s music. Even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more! Why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.\\n\\nMary, Mungo and Midge. But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block? Yeah but no but I wasn\\'t even there!\\n\\nI\\'d like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role. Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.\\n\\nIt demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today\\'s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. There are plany of modern children\\'s book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?\\n\\nMr. Benn with Rowan Atkinson as the lead.\\n\\nWould have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn\\'t come up to scratch. The only one that isn\\'t to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I\\'d like to see.\\n\\nI\\'m an expat living in Norway, and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite children\\'s programs for my 2 daughters. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Very Scandinavian...\\n\\nRainbow!\\n\\nI believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it\\'s original, witty, and modern. The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.\\n\\nHow about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!\\n\\nIf a Transformers movie is indeed on the cards then I\\'ll be the first one on Amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! I don\\'t care! Till then I\\'ll have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert.\\n\\nI\\'d luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden, superb children\\'s programme. Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on. Danger Mouse? At 34 I\\'m showing my age. :-)\\n\\nNoggin the Nog was one of the best children\\'s programs. The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate\\'s wonderful voices. So in general leave well alone. The originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.\\n\\nJust imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse\\n\\nBob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. In the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns, Krusty and Gobo. Will they triumph or will they fail miserably? Find out this Fall.\\n\\nOne puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90. It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe\\'s car. Of course, Gerry Anderson\\'s Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children\\'t movie that really let it down. After all, the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.\\n\\nIt\\'s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn\\'t it? I\\'d hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that \\'done in a shed\\' clunkiness and you couldn\\'t recreate the magic. Perhaps if the remakes were done in a \\'Look Around You\\' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...\\n\\nChorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!\\n\\nThis re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people\\'s ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. The same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material, Will Young etc. The sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. Starsky & Hutch) Hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!\\n\\nI pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies. I\\'m only 27 and don\\'t remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it\\'s a classic. The fact it\\'s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today\\'s stuff it looks amateurish. Thats the appeal though, it\\'s so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.\\n',\n",

However, chief executive Bill Gammell cautioned that additional evalution was first needed at the site. Cairn has also been granted approval to extend its Rajasthan exploration area. This approval has come from the Indian government.\\n\\nA spokesman said the company\\'s decision to carry out further investigations at the new find showed that it believed there was significant gas. But he added: \"It\\'s still too early to say what the extent of it is.\" Cairn\\'s string of finds in Rajasthan last year saw it elevated to the FTSE 100 index of the UK\\'s leading listed companies. The company had bought the rights to explore in the area from oil giant Shell. Mr Gammell is a former Scottish international rugby player.\\n',\n",

Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman \"from a more discreet angle\" instead.\\n\\nThe US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 (Â£306,814) last autumn for singer Janet Jackson\\'s \"wardrobe malfunction\", during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with Justin Timberlake. Many US networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity, violence or bad language. Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing \"an important film\". \"You want to pick your battles,\" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation\\'s 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming. PBS is seen in virtually all US homes with TV, and describes itself as a \"trusted community resource\" serving nearly 100 million people each week.\\n',\n",

Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said.\\n\\nFive of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men\\'s solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.\\n\\n\"There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,\" he said. \"If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can\\'t do so retrospectively. \"We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it.\" They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates\\' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: \"I have no regrets. \"We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country.\" One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.\\n\\nThe other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker\\'s chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.\\n\\nSpeaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was \"impossibly difficult to determine\" and open to different interpretations.\\n',\n",

Stern will join the Sirius subscription service, which is not governed by US regulators, next year. Citadel pulled Stern\\'s show from stations in New York and Pennsylvania. Stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 January. Citadel said it did not yet know whether it would return to its network.\\n\\nStern announced in October that he was leaving conventional radio, where his syndicated show goes out across the US, for the relatively restriction-free satellite service. The DJ\\'s broadcasts are well known for landing in trouble with regulators for obscene and sexually explicit rantings. Stern was dropped by six stations owned by media giant Clear Channel in 2004 after it had to pay the Federal Communications Commission $1.75m (Â£950,000), over breaches indecency laws. Media giant Viacom has also reportedly agreed to the FCC\\'s demands that if Stern is issued with another indecency violation then his show must be pulled from all of its stations. Viacom has also been hit with record fines of $3.5m (Â£1.8m) over Stern and two other New York DJs. But Stern continues to be one of the most popular talk show hosts, particularly in the 25-54 age category.\\n',\n",

There have been suggestions that Wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the New Year. But he told the Evening Standard: \"I don\\'t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in January.\" The Gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old Almunia has made to his career at Highbury. And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday.\\n\\nAlmunia was at fault for Rosenborg\\'s goal in Arsenal\\'s 5-1 Champions League win on Tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week\\'s win over Birmingham. But Wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. \"The debate has gone on too long. Everyone has an opinion and I do not have to add to it,\" Wenger added. Arsenal have been linked with Middlesbrough keeper Mark Schwarzer, Fulham\\'s Edwin van der Sar and Parma\\'s Sebastien Frey.

       " 'Brown comes out shooting\\n\\nLabour may have abolished hunting - but that didn\\'t stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties\\' core election foxes.\\n\\nSpecifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families. In a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre-election boost everyone had been predicting. So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Brown\\'s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government. Like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.\\n\\nThe announcements brought great cheers from his own MPs who are now in full-on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps. They obviously believed he had done that for them and, coincidentally, given his own image as a prime minister-in-waiting another little boost.\\n\\nLabour MPs, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely Old Labour word - this chancellor really is. But Gordon Brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win Labour an historic third term, his demeanour remained quiet, confident and reassuring. Prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to Britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else. According to the opposition parties, however, it is all one big con trick.\\n\\nAs always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the \"black hole\" at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election. He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax. As Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy claimed, for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the Treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. He branded it a dodgy \"vote now pay later\" budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave Britain the dodgy dossier. Where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering, Mr Howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing Mr Brown\\'s forecasts to the prime minister\\'s forecasts on Iraq\\'s weapons of mass destruction. As ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties\\' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor\\'s red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws. In particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal. And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election.\\n',\n",
       " 'Iran budget seeks state sell-offs\\n\\nIran\\'s president, Mohammad Khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the Islamic republic\\'s dependence on oil.\\n\\nThe budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 March calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state\\'s corporate holdings. Mr Khatami\\'s second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget. But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. Elections in May 2004 ousted many of Mr Khatami\\'s supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. The ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by Turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with Israel. It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran\\'s ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami\\'s policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami\\'s hope of modestly reducing the government\\'s reliance on oil revenues.\\n\\nIn an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year. He said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; Â£93.6bn) from the previous year\\'s 1,070 trillion. Within that figure, taxation would rise to $14.3bn, a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005. \"Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,\" Mr Khatami said. \"Oil revenues should be used for productive investment.\" Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.\\n',\n",

The economy is benefiting from a quieter period in Palestinian-Israeli violence and a pick-up in global demand for technology products. The outlook is better than it has been for a number of years, analysts said.\\n\\nMany companies have focused on cost cutting and greater efficiency, while the government has been trying to trim public spending and push through reforms. The growth figures come about despite a strike earlier this year by about 400,000 public sector worker which closed banks, hospitals, postal services and transport facilities. Growth did slow in the second half, but only slightly. Exports for the year rose by 14%, while tourist revenues were up by 30%. Imports gained by 13%, signalling that domestic demand has picked up again. In 2003, imports declined by 1.8%. In 2003, the economy expanded by 1.3%\\n\",\n",

Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said that, if in government, he would refuse to approve either Mr Boateng\\'s appointment or that of ex-Cabinet minister Helen Liddell as high commissioner to Australia. \"Mr Blair\\'s appointment of Paul Boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed Tony\\'s cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts,\" he said.\\n',\n",

The last \"Downing Street dad\" was Lord John Russell in 1848. Labour won a huge majority of 167 over the Conservatives in 2001, but Mr Blair has since been criticised by many in his own party.

A man was shot in the thigh outside New York\\'s Hot 97 studios while 50 Cent was on air. More shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later. 50 Cent appeared on The Game\\'s debut album, which was number one in the US. 50 Cent, whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hip-hop\\'s biggest stars, has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including Fat Joe, Nas and Jadakiss.\\n\\nHe has claimed credit for the success of The Game, who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene.

There\\'s no way that I\\'m walking away.\" However, he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute. \"I\\'d like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation,\" he said.\\n\\n\"When you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you, who are jealous and want to try to drag you down. \"When you have that situation, you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through. \"There was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of Scottish rugby and that is simply not the case. \"Like all good coaches, you go and ask for an increase. But we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that. \"The idea that we are lighting cigars with Â£20 notes while the rest of Scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue. \"We also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team. \"But let me give you the truth. Our Irish counterparts, whom we have to compete with in a few days\\' time, had 70 days together at the summer. \"They are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the Six Nations. \"That means they will have 91 days away from their club from July until the Six Nations. We, on the other hand, will have 16. \"There must be a win-win philosophy and attitude within Scottish rugby and that is what we are after - both groups winning, not competing.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Sales \\'fail to boost High Street\\'\\n\\nThe January sales have failed to help the UK High Street recover from a poor Christmas season, a survey has found.\\n\\nStores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. Consumers remain cautious over buying big-ticket items like furniture, said BRC director general Kevin Hawkins. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.\\n\\nIn the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. \"Following a relatively strong New Year\\'s bank holiday, trading then took a downward turn,\" said Mr Hawkins. \"Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers.\" The previous BRC survey found Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years for retailers. And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.\\n',\n",
       " 'The comic book genius of Stan Lee\\n\\nStan Lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit Spider-Man movies.\\n\\nMany marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\\n\\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\\n\\nLee\\'s answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee\\'s life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York\\'s skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\\n\\n\"Just because he\\'s a hero and has super powers doesn\\'t mean he doesn\\'t have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee\\'s influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel\\'s covers.\\n\\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (Â£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.\\n',\n",
       " \"Hearts 2-1 Livingston\\n\\nHearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.\\n\\nLee Miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.\\n\\nThen McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, Burton O'Brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.\\n\\nGordon, Webster, Miller, Hartley, Neilson, McAllister, Simmons (MacFarlane 64), Berra, Burchill (Wyness 82), Mikoliunas (Cesnauskis 77), Wallace.\\n\\nMoilanen, Kizys.\\n\\nBerra, Webster.\\n\\nMiller 1, McAllister 10.\\n\\nMeldrum, McNamee, Bahoken (Stanic 45), Deloumeaux, Strong, Dair, Easton, Mark Wilson (Vincze 45), Lilley (Horvath 45), O'Brien, McPake.\\n\\nMcKenzie, Hand.\\n\\n: Vincze, Horvath.\\n\\nEaston 60.\\n\\n9,796\\n\\nA Freeland\\n\",\n",

Creditors agreed on Friday to suspend interest payments until 2007. News of the deal had boosted shares in the club on Friday, but the stock slipped back 7% during Monday morning.\\n\\nIn addition to the interest-payment freeze, Borussia Dortmund also will get short-term loans to help pay salaries. It estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m; Â£21m) until the end of June if it is to pay its bills. The football club is hoping that all its creditors will agree to defer rent payments on its Westfalen stadium. Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend. Three creditors have yet to agree to the deal struck last week. On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club\\'s stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Chief executive Gerd Niebaum stepped down last week and creditors have been pushing for a greater say in how the club is run. Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club. The club posted a record loss of 68m euros in the 12 months through June. Adding to its woes, Borussia Dortmund was beaten 5-0 by Bayern Munich on Saturday.\\n',\n",
       " 'Russian ex-spy on hunger strike\\n\\nAn ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.\\n\\nViktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an \"average British citizen\". But despite a Â£65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. \"Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. It can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work,\" Mr Makarov told the BBC\\'s Newsnight programme. \"Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other.\"\\n\\nOleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was \"very happy\" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Commenting on Mr Makarov\\'s case, he said: \"The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.\" But Mr Makarov\\'s case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. \"I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,\" Mr Kahn said.\\n\\nMr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year-old. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers. But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland.\\n\\nThrough his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service. He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 - a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle. Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities he\\'d been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia. He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for Â£65,000 to buy a small house. But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.\\n',\n",

Less welcome was the news that the firm had been fined 11m euros for having violated takeover rules five years ago. The firm sought bankruptcy protection in December 2003 after disclosing a 4bn-euro hole in its accounts. Overall, the company's debt is close to 12bn euros, and is falling only slowly. Its brands, well-known in Italy and overseas, have continued to perform strongly, however, and have barely lost revenue since the scandal broke.\\n\\nBut a crucial factor for the company's future is the legal unwinding of its intensely complex financial position. On Tuesday, the company's administrator, turnaround expert Enrico Bondi, sued Morgan Stanley, its former banker, to return 136m euros relating to a 2003 bond deal. That brought to 49 the number of banks that Mr Bondi has sued, a mass of legal action that could bring in as much as 3bn euros. The company has also sued former auditors and financial advisors for damages. And criminal cases against the company's former management are proceeding separately.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Kenyan school turns to handhelds\\n\\nAt the Mbita Point primary school in western Kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.\\n\\nThey are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. It is a pilot project run by EduVision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. Matthew Herren from EduVision told the BBC programme Go Digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called E-slates. \"The E-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. This in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. The data is transmitted alongside audio signals.\" The base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld E-slates. \"It downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. It also stores this on its hard disc.\"\\n\\nThe system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. But Mr Herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. \"It\\'s very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it\\'s also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.\"\\n\\nThe project is still at the pilot stage and EduVision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the Linux-based system. \"The content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. Users can scroll through these sections independently of each other.\" EduVision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. Mr Herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. He is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site Google to digitise some of the world\\'s largest university libraries. \"All books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. Then every rural school in Africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in Oxford and Harvard\" Currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. But Mr Herren says EduVision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions. \"We plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the E-slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.\" Maciej Sundra, who designed the user interface for the E-slates, says the project\\'s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. \"Why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks? The fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting - as they need it most.\"\\n',\n",

Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC\\'s funding rules. The FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the PBGC fund. The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members, who include Nobel economics laureate William Sharpe. It said it was \"dismayed\" at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation.\\n\\nCash-strapped US companies, including those in the airline, car-making and steel industries, had argued in favour of the 2004 rule change, claiming that funding the insurance premiums adequately would force them to have to cut jobs. \"With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,\" said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. The PBGC was founded in 1974 to protect workers\\' retirement rights. Its most recent action came last week when it took control of the pilots\\' pension scheme at United Airlines. With United battling bankruptcy, the carrier had wanted to use the money set aside for pensions to finance running costs. The company has an estimated $2.9bn hole in its pilots\\' pension scheme, which the PBGC will now guarantee.\\n',\n",

       " 'A decade of good website design\\n\\nThe web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.\\n\\nBack in 1994, Yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text-based and Amazon, Google and eBay had yet to appear. But, says usability guru Dr Jakob Nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. Dr Nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today. \"Roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today,\" he said. \"Some have gone away because users have changed and 10% have changed because technology has changed.\"\\n\\nSome design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said Dr Nielsen.\\n\\n\"But there\\'s great stability on usability concerns,\" he told the BBC News website. Dr Nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site\\'s total design, were as important as ever. \"It\\'s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such,\" he said. They are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would. \"A lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off,\" he said. \"But there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband.\"\\n\\nDr Nielsen said the success of sites such as Google, Amazon, eBay and Yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. \"Those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful,\" said Dr Nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.\\n\\n\"All are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet,\" he said. \"They are making simple but powerful tools available to the user. \"None of them have a fancy or glamorous look,\" he added, declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied. In the future, Dr Nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online. \"They are becoming like the operating system to the internet,\" he said. But, he said, the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better. Currently, he said, search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries. Often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not. Tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results. Research by Dr Nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines. The latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms. In 1994 only 1.3 words were used. \"I think it\\'s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10-year period of those search terms,\" said Dr Nielsen.\\n\\nYou can hear more from Jakob Nielsen and web design on the BBC World Service programme, Go Digital\\n',\n",
       " 'Jackson film \\'absolute disaster\\'\\n\\nA PR expert has told the Michael Jackson child abuse trial that the TV documentary at the heart of the case was an \"absolute disaster\".\\n\\nAnn Kite told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria she was hired to \"crisis manage\" the fallout after the programme had aired in 2003. Jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday. Mr Jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. If convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison.\\n\\nMs Kite suggested Jackson\\'s associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser\\'s family after the airing of Martin Bashir\\'s film Living with Michael Jackson. She told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast, a Jackson lawyer had told her the boy\\'s mother would be made to look like a \"crack whore\". Jackson\\'s defence questioned Ms Kite\\'s credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer\\'s team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.\\n\\nMs Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.\\n\\nMs Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson\\'s lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened. \"I said, `Don\\'t make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch\\',\" she said. Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe. The documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into Mr Jackson\\'s relationship with the boy. In the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.\\n\\nQuestioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \"beyond disaster\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution\\'s first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \"shield\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution\\'s opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\\n',\n",

Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers.\\n\\nIt will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. \"There will be a period of adjustment required,\" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. \"Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. \"Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.\"\\n\\nChristian Aid has called on British firms not to simply \"cut and run\" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags.\\n\\nIt added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world\\'s fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country\\'s exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. \"The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,\" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid\\'s head of Trade Policy, said. \"They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. \"We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers.\" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.\\n\\nIt added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should \"put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost\". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. \"International trade must not be governed by a \\'race to the bottom\\' that pitches one set of poor people against another,\" Mr Pendleton added.\\n',\n",

Latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies.\\n\\n\"It is obviously very, very encouraging for Sony because Microsoft briefly outsold them last week,\" John Houlihan, editor of Computerandvideogames.com told BBC News. \"And with Halo 2 [for Xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and Xbox.\"\\n\\nAlthough Xbox sales over the last week also climbed, PS2 sales were more than double that. The figures mean Sony is reaching the seven million barrier for UK sales of the console. Edinburgh-based developer, Rockstar, which is behind the GTA titles, has seen San Andreas pull in an estimated Â£24m in gross revenues over the weekend. In comparison, blockbuster films like Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban took Â£11.5m in its first three days at the UK box office. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took nearly Â£10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.\\n\\nGangster-themed GTA San Andreas is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto Vice City which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. The original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies.\\n\\nMr Houlihan added that Sony had done well with the PS2, but it definitely helped that the release of San Andreas coincided with the slimline PS2 hitting the shelves. The run-up to Christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. Microsoft\\'s Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate. Sony and Microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. \"Both have hit crucial price points at around Â£100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales,\" said Mr Houlihan.\\n',\n",
       " 'EU software patent law delayed\\n\\nControversial new EU rules for the patenting of computer-based inventions have been put on hold due to a last minute intervention from Poland.\\n\\nPoland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones. They say it could have massive ramifications for developments such as open source software.\\n\\nPolish ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes the patenting of software. The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US. So, for instance, US-based Amazon.com holds a patent on \\'one-click shopping\\'. Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas. \"Patent rights, it is claimed, protect inventors but in this case it is exclusively the interests of the big companies that are protected,\" Eva Lichtenberg, a Austrian Green member of the European Parliament said in a statement. \"Smaller, innovative firms cannot afford the patenting and legal costs that the directive would inflict on them,\" she added. The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic. The directive has been subject to several previous delays.\\n',\n",
       " 'Reaction from Spanish press\\n\\nEngland\\'s 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country\\'s press on Thursday.\\n\\nControversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of England\\'s black players, Wayne Rooney\\'s petulance and England\\'s inept performance. But what did the Spanish press make of the affair? BBC Sport looks at the reaction. \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is little coverage of the racist chanting on Wednesday night\\'s game. But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britain\\'s colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October. Journalist Guillem Balague writes: \"In our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the English nervous.\"\\n\\nMarca refers in passing to the booing of England\\'s black players - but only after referring to the cheers of \"ole\" which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession. Aragones\\' \"no comment\" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coach\\'s praise for his players. Serbia & Montenegro\\'s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win in Belgium - which could make qualification tougher for Spain - seems to be of greater importance.\\n\\nElsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. \"Were there racist chants against some players? This hasn\\'t happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years,\" said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido. \"So you (English reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this.\" And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones. \"Perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue,\" the paper says. \\n\\n \\n\\n\"What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him.\" Yet Rooney is seen only as the worst example of many England miscreants, with Gary Neville criticised for continuing the feud between Manchester United and Arsenal for his tackles on Jose Reyes. Ashley Cole\\'s treatment of Joaquin, and a Frank Lampard foul on Reyes are also lambasted for their \"ugliness\".\\n\\nMarca\\'s headline says it all: \"Wayne Rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el Bernab&#233;u (Wayne Rooney became crazy in the Bernabeu)\" Rooney\\'s display alarms the writer, in particular three \"chilling\" fouls on Joaquin, Casillas and Marchena, which \"could well have left them in the infirmary.\" And like AS, Marca criticises Gary Neville for \"leaving a message on Reyes\\' ankle\" to remind him of the Manchester United-Arsenal clash this month. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpain\\'s first-half performance is showered with praise, with Xavi singled out as the biggest star. \"Xavi did things on Wednesday which were worthy of Maradona,\" the paper beams, adding, \"What a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player!\" On a controversial evening, AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: \"Spanish football players played better football than the English.\"\\n\\nMore plaudits are given to the home team, with Jaime Vargas lauding the manner in which \"Spain dominated England with order and quality\". The paper adds: \"The bad thing about Spain v England was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition.\" Vargas does not mention England\\'s two Galacticos, simply adding in a PS: \"I have not forgotten to speak of Beckham and Owen. They forgot to play.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC\\n\\nNicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT\\'s Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (Â£53).\\n\\nHe told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be \" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood\". He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, \"We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.\\n\\n\"The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory.\" The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.\\n\\nWhile the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. \"We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it\\'s also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook.\" Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. \"Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we\\'re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we\\'re not talking about doing it in three or five years, we\\'re talking about months.\" He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. \"In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. That\\'s for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that\\'s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Drink remark \\'acts as diversion\\'\\n\\nThe first minister\\'s statement that it was okay to get drunk \"once in a while\" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.\\n\\nJack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell\\'s comment was \"ill-advised\". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland\\'s binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\\n\\nThe one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\\n\\nMr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland\\'s fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\\n\\nThe Scottish National Party\\'s Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I \\'should encourage young people to get drunk\\'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Rangers seal Old Firm win\\n\\nGoals from Gregory Vignal and Nacho Novo gave Rangers a scrappy victory at Celtic Park that moves them three points clear of the champions.\\n\\nRangers had rarely threatened until Celtic goalkeeper Rab Douglas let defender Vignal's 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. Opposite number Ronald Waterreus had been Rangers' hero, saving superbly from Craig Bellamy and John Hartson. Striker Novo secured victory, lobbing Douglas with eight minutes remaining. It ended Celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in Old Firm derbies and gave Rangers manager Alex McLeish his first victory at the home of his Glasgow rivals. Celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. They started confidently, with new signing Bellamy, on loan from Newcastle United, given his Celtic debut up front with Wales international colleague John Hartson and Chris Sutton dropping into midfield. It took Bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on Marvin Andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by Waterreus at the second attempt. He had an even better chance after Hartson dispossesed Sotiris Kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. But Waterreus did well to beat away Bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. Waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to Hartson just inside the box and the Dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. It was an Old Firm return for Barry Ferguson as McLeish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past Hibernian. But Rangers found Celtic harder to break down and Douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. Dado Prso turned inside Neil Lennon only for the Celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. A great defensive header by Andrews prevented Hartson pouncing from five yards out. Hartson foxed Vignal at the edge of the Rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by Waterreus. Rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and Vignal, collecting a knock back from Fernando Ricksen, broke the deadlock, Douglas somehow letting the Frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. Novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the Celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from Ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing Douglas. Ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent Rangers' celebrations at the final whistle.\\n\\n: Douglas, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Laursen, Petrov, Lennon, Sutton, Thompson, Bellamy, Hartson.\\n\\nSubs: Marshall, Henchoz, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Maloney, Wallace, McGeady.\\n\\n: Waterreus, Hutton, Kyrgiakos, Andrews, Ball, Buffel, Ferguson, Ricksen, Vignal, Prso, Novo.\\n\\nSubs: McGregor, Namouchi, Burke, Alex Rae, Malcolm, Thompson, Lovenkrands.\\n\\n: M McCurry\\n\",\n",
       " 'Double injury blow strikes Wales\\n\\nWales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday\\'s game with Italy because of injury.\\n\\nParker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre. Jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against England and joins flanker Colin Charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first-choice kicker in Rome. The centre was Wales\\' hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. First-choice kicker Stephen Jones handed over responsibility because of Henson\\'s greater kicking range, but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal. \"Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we\\'ll talk about in selection this week,\" Wales coach Mike Ruddock told BBC Sport Wales. Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturday\\'s game. \"I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,\" he said. \"I\\'m glad it\\'s a short week before the Italy game. There was so much build-up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and we\\'ll be back playing again.\"\\n',\n",

Third generation mobiles, the digital home and broadband are key themes at the show. Camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better. Samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a 7-megapixel phone on the opening day.\\n\\nThe SCH-V770 has some of the features of high-end digital single lens reflex cameras such as manual focus and the ability to attach a telephoto or wide-angle lens. Camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said Ben Wood, principal analyst at research firm Gartner. \"It is firmly established that cameras are an integral part of phones and now the technology arms race is on in terms of megapixels. There will be a certain amount of \\'look how big mine is\\',\" he said. There will also be increasing focus on music-enabled mobiles. \"At 3GSM in Cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at Cebit,\" said Mr Wood. Sony Ericsson will use the fair to show off the W800 - its recently unveiled Walkman branded phone - and there is speculation that Motorola may unveil its ROKR handset, widely tipped as the first to carry Apple\\'s iTunes music software. Apple and Motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between Motorola\\'s chief executive Ed Zander and Steve Jobs.\\n\\nSome analysts think Motorola may save the launch for CTIA, a wireless show in America the following week, which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the German tech fair.\\n\\n\"One of the interesting things is that CeBIT is clearly a show in decline,\" said Mr Wood. \"A lot of the big players, such as Nokia, are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. It could be the last big year for Cebit,\" he said. Other themes include TV-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as Vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. There has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile TV - French operators are teaming up, O2 is trialling a system in Oxford, UK, and Nokia begins trialling a system in Finland with the Finnish Broadcasting Company, YLE TV and commercial TV channels. Cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting TV on to mobiles, and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with 3G. HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) has been described as \"3G on steroids\" and could offer consumers much faster download times. For instance, a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in 10 seconds. Korean giants LG Electronics and Samsung will show off HSDPA handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the US, Europe and Korea next year. Broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this year\\'s killer application.\\n\\nGermany\\'s largest online service provider, T-Online, is tipped to reveal software for low-cost net telephony which would see it competing with its parent company Deutsche Telekom. Cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. Rainbow-coloured phones, influenced by handsets from Japan, are just one example of how Asian companies will stamp their mark on this year\\'s show, at which they will have their biggest ever presence. Cebit organisers have created a digital home in Hall 25 of the 27 hangar-like buildings that will house the show. \"The digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. The house will be totally wired and full of things that can be used for home entertainment,\" said Cebit organiser Gabriele Dorries.\\n',\n",

Johnson won 84 England caps and quit Test rugby at the start of 2004, just two months after leading Sir Clive Woodward\\'s team to victory in Sydney. The 34-year-old Leicester lock\\'s final match will be his testimonial at Twickenham on 4 June. \"I\\'m confident I have made the right decision to retire,\" said Johnson. \"I\\'m sure there will be times next season when I\\'ll wish I was out there playing for the Tigers, but you know when the time is right to go and I feel this is the right time. \"I feel physically that I could play for another season, but playing week in and week out in the Premiership is a full-time occupation and I only want to be out there for the right reasons.\" Johnson will always be revered by England fans for captaining England to their dramatic World Cup win against Australia in Sydney, but his list of achievements does not stop at that.\\n\\nHe is the only man to captain the Lions twice and he also led England to a Six Nations Grand Slam. Johnson also had huge success as captain of Leicester, guiding the Tigers to back to back Heineken Cup victories and several Premiership titles. Apart from his marvellous captaincy Johnson was also one of the finest second rows to ever play the game. Teak tough and physically intimidating, he ruled the rucks and mauls for the best part of a decade and was integral in England\\'s rise to the top of the world game. His final appearance will be in his testimonial at Twickenham, where he will lead a team against a side captained by New Zealand winger Jonah Lomu. The All Black is aiming to return to action after a kidney transplant and Johnson expects it to be a memorable occasion. \"This game against Jonah will be a great way to end the season and end my career,\" said Johnson. Lomu, rugby union\\'s first global superstar after his exploits in the 1995 World Cup, said he was proud to be part of Johnson\\'s farewell. \"We hold him in such high esteem,\" said Lomu. \"He is such a great leader and I am just honoured to be on the same pitch.\"\\n',\n",

The fresh delay came after Polish officials had raised concerns about the law for the second time in two months. Critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open-source software innovation. \"There was at one point the intention to put the item on today\\'s agenda. But in the end we could not put it on,\" an EU spokesman told the Reuters agency. He added that no date had been chosen for more discussion of the law.\\n\\nIn December, Poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. Its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the Directive on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting. Poland is a large EU member, so its backing for the legislation is vital. The EU says the law would bring Europe more in line with how such laws work in the US, but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted. This means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service. Critics say a similar model in Europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies. But supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.\\n',\n",

Burnley have major injury concerns over Frank Sinclair and John McGreal. Michael Duff looks set to continue at right-back with John Oster in midfield and Micah Hyde is expected to recover from a knee injury.\\n\\n- Blackburn boss Mark Hughes: \"Burnley are resolute and have individual talent but I fully expect us to progress. \"I thought we were comfortable in the first game and never thought we were under pressure. \"It\\'s a competition we want to progress in and we are doing okay.

But they\\'ve not been beaten in the competition by a club outside the Premiership for nine years, since Ipswich - then in the second tier - defeated them 0-1 after extra time in a third round replay at Ewood Park on 16 January 1996. History is on Rovers side. When they last met their near neighbours in the FA Cup 45 years ago, it also required an Ewood Park replay, which the home side won 2-0, and when they last met in the League, Rovers did the double. They first won their Nationwide Division One trip to Turf Moor 0-2 four seasons ago, and then thrashed the Clarets on home soil 5-0. \\n - Manager Mark Hughes, who won the Cup four times as a player, is aiming to steer Rovers into the quarter-finals for the second time in 12 years, and first time since the 2000/2001 season. Success here, and victory home to Leicester in the next round, could see Rovers in the semi-finals without having played Premiership opposition. \\n - BURNLEY make the eight mile journey to their fierce rivals, determined to send Blackburn the same way as Liverpool in the third round. But having failed to pull off another shock at Turf Moor, it could be that the Championship outfit - 17 places inferior on the League ladder - have missed their best opportunity. Having said that, Burnley are yet to concede a goal in this Cup run. \\n - Steve Cotterills\\' Clarets have been knocked out in the fifth round four times in the last seven years, and have made only one appearance in the sixth round in 21 years. That was in the season before last, when they disposed of Premiership Fulham at this fifth round stage. \\n - While Blackburn have not played since the fifth round tie, Burnley have had two League outings away from home, drawing 1-1 at Derby and losing 1-0 at Preston. That takes their winless run to four games. The combatants from one-time prosperous mill towns, are both founder members of the Football League.

But on Friday he said: \"I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect.\" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had \"cleverly\" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman \"totally refuted\" any wrongdoing.\\n\\nMr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.\\n\\nExplaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: \"I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. \"However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. \"To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. \"I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.\"\\n\\nLabour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was \"very clever\" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. \"He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,\" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings \"where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner\". However, MSPs\\' Code of Conduct \"recognises a wider definition\" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.\\n\\nBut a letter from Holyrood\\'s Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie\\'s decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: \"This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn\\'t breach the paid advocacy rules in future. \"However it doesn\\'t change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.\"\\n\\nScottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents.

Downloaded singles have now overtaken physical singles in the UK. Mr Jamieson said his organisation was lobbying music service providers, which include iTunes and Napster, to urge them to promote independent releases. Download sales are due to be incorporated into the UK singles chart later this year. \"With downloads shortly to be eligible for the singles chart, this is a key commercial issue on which the BPI committed to assisting its members,\" added Mr Jamieson. As part of the campaign the BPI is running a series of seminars entitled Getting Your Music Online, focusing on how independent labels can embrace digital music. The US has already begun incorporating download sales in the Billboard\\'s Hot 100 chart.\\n',\n",
       " \"DVD review: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\n\\nThis third Harry Potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake-up that really shines on DVD.\\n\\nGone are the warm, bright colours found in the two earlier films, Alfonso Cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous - and looks even better here than in the cinema. It is all part of the progression of Harry's story into darker areas, but you'll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful Hogwarts landscape.\\n\\nThis is the first Potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book. It is the third year at Hogwarts and studies are interrupted, as they always are, by a calamity that only Harry, Ron and Hermione can put right.\\n\\nIt sounds corny. But Harry is no longer the winsome hero, he is a moody teenager and Daniel Radcliffe pulls it off very well. Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD. But it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast. But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. Younger viewers will go for the games which include a Magic You May Have Missed memory test, and Crookshanks chasing off after Scabbers. Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. You will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it, as we did on the first Harry Potter DVD. The most interesting pieces are an interview with JK Rowling in Creating The Vision and Conjuring A Scene, a short featurette about the making of the film's big moments.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Swap offer for pirated Windows XP\\n\\nComputer giant Microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of Windows XP with legal ones.\\n\\nThe first-time initiative is restricted to the UK and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in PCs bought before November. Until December Microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. The company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of Windows into legitimate ones.\\n\\nThe Windows XP Counterfeit Project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year. It is the first time Microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the BBC News website. In June, the software giant said that the major security update to Windows XP, Service Pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. The upgrade closed security loopholes in XP and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code.\\n\\nThe US company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of Windows XP to submit it for testing as soon as possible. The procedure consists of a series of computer checks, collating documents, and filling out a witness statement. \"This is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of Windows XP software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders\", said Alex Hilton, licence compliance manager at Microsoft. The scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. \"It is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products\", said David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. The plan would enable Microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way, which would allow it to take action against software pirates. Microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the UK programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.\\n',\n",

The group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up American television. But a spokeswoman for MTV said it was \"unfair and inaccurate\" to single out MTV for criticism.\\n\\nThe PTC monitored MTV\\'s output for 171 hours from 20 March to 27 March 2004, during the channel\\'s Spring Break coverage. In its report - MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs and Alcohol - the PTC said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex. Brent Bozell, PTC president and conservative activist said: \"MTV is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids. \"Compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, MTV\\'s programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence - and MTV\\'s shows are aimed at children as young as 12. \"There\\'s no question that TV influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and MTV is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children.\"\\n\\nThe watchdog decided to look at MTV\\'s programmes after Janet Jackson\\'s infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" at last year\\'s Super Bowl. The breast-baring incident generated 500,000 complaints and CBS - which is owned by the same parent company as MTV - was quick to apologise. MTV spokeswoman Jeannie Kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in. \"It\\'s unfair and inaccurate to paint MTV with that brush of irresponsibility,\" she said. \"We think it\\'s underestimating young people\\'s intellect and level of sophistication.\" Ms Kedas also highlighted the fact MTV won an award in 2004 for the Fight for Your Rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.\\n',\n",

Ferguson\\'s own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.\\n\\n\"Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone\\'s trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe\\'s most prestigious club title two seasons ago.

Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a Â£15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension. A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:\"We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.\" Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea\\'s statement added: \"This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called \\'recreational\\' drugs. They have no place at our club or in sport. \"In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club\\'s social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. \"Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules. \"The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases.\" Fifa\\'s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. And the sport\\'s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu\\'s failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. \"Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it,\" said a Fifa spokesman. Chelsea\\'s move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken. Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. \"Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. \"It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. \"It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.\" It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. The Romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. The Football Association has yet to act on Mutu\\'s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.\\n',\n",

Friends and family, including actress Ruby Dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the Riverside Church on Saturday. Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy. \"He would have been a very good president of the United States,\" said Mr Clinton. \"Like most of you here, he gave more to me than I gave to him.\"\\n\\nThe 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film. Police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. Davis made his acting debut in 1950 in No Way Out starring Sidney Poiter. He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father\\'s funeral. \"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,\" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. \"Ditto.\" \"Ossie was my hero, and he still is,\" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. \"Ossie was a thing of beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,\" added Burt Reynolds, Davis\\'s co-star in the 90s TV comedy Evening Shade.

London mayor Mr Livingstone says he is \"standing by\" his remarks which likened an Evening Standard journalist to a \"concentration camp guard\". But the prime minister says it is time for Mr Livingstone to say sorry.\\n\\nLabour\\'s Mr Livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist, and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if Mr Blair asked. Later the prime minister said: \"A lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a Jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise.\"\\n\\nHowever, Mr Johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about Liverpudlians grieving over the death of British hostage Ken Bigley, said Mr Blair \"should butt out of\" the row. \"I don\\'t see why the prime minister has to get involved in this,\" The Spectator editor told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme. \"It\\'s a dispute between Ken Livingstone and a reporter on the Evening Standard.\" Mr Johnson, MP for Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, said he suspected Labour was now trying to reassure Jewish voters \"because of this curious way in which Labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned Muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war\".\\n\\n\"Ken doesn\\'t think he\\'s got anything to say sorry for and if that\\'s really his feeling, then I think that he should stick to his guns,\" he said. Mr Johnson apologised last October for perpetuating an \"outdated stereotype\" of Liverpool in the leader article on the death of Mr Bigley. The article in the magazine suggested grieving Liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. It also attributed blame to drunken Liverpool football fans for the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. Mr Johnson told Today: \"It\\'s perfectly true that I got into the grovelling game myself and when I apologised there were some things that I felt I ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things I didn\\'t think I should apologise for,\" he said. \"But here\\'s old Ken - he\\'s been crass, he\\'s been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but I don\\'t think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, I don\\'t think he was actually anti-Semitic.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'Minimum wage increased to Â£5.05\\n\\nThe minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.\\n\\nAdults must be paid at least Â£5.05 an hour, up from Â£4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid Â£4.25. The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. Businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a Â£6 rate.\\n\\nA further increase in the adult rate to Â£5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for October 2006. According to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage \"challenging\". \"We have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,\" said chairman Adair Turner. The government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.\\n\\nUnveiling the latest increase, Mr Blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a \"symbol of decency and fairness\". \"For too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families,\" he said. \"Too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay.\" Chancellor Gordon Brown and Transport Secretary Alistair Darling promoted the news in Edinburgh, Wales Secretary Peter Hain and Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan in Cardiff and Northern Ireland Minister John Spellar in Belfast. The government has not accepted the commission\\'s recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on. Mr Brown said: \"We want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people, particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time.\" The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.\\n\\nThe national minimum wage is currently set at Â£4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at Â£4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. A Â£3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last October for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt. The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a Â£6 minimum wage by next year. But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a \"pause year\" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October. And David Frost, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"The level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. \"What employers are saying to us now is that it\\'s at a level where it\\'s starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.\"\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats\\' economics spokesman Vincent Cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. \"It\\'s not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the Exchequer too,\" he said. Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not \"seek to disturb\" the increase. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\\'s Woman\\'s Hour, Mr Howard hinted the Tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. \"There are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn\\'t be paying income tax,\" he said.\\n\\nIt would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below Â£12,000 a year, with say no tax on below Â£6,000. The losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over Â£100,000. Our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the US minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the US! Perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the US. This combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.\\n\\nIt\\'s still not good enough! I got a part time Job at 16 when I was doing my A-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for Uni. This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid Â£2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it\\'s about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!\\n\\nWe must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. An easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.\\n\\nAny increase is certainly welcome news. However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: \"Would you be happy to work for less than Â£5.05 an hour?\". Thought not ... so then, don\\'t expect others to either.\\n\\nI can\\'t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! Also I personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you? It\\'s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn\\'t go a miss either. br /&gt;\\n\\nThis is good news. The minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker\\'s relationship with their employer. Wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee\\'s efforts. For too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. In very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. With the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.\\n\\nIt is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. They are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!\\n\\nI feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can\\'t afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.\\n\\nHere come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! We all remember Michael Howard\\'s protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he\\'s gone quiet on that one! Jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. I think if any job is worth doing then it\\'s worth being paid a fair wage for, and Â£5.05 is hardly a fortune. If your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it\\'s not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!\\n\\nGreat keep at it Tony, I remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. At last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. We can\\'t afford not to pay a decent wage. It\\'s not a jobs at any price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency.\\n\\nThe increase in minimum wage is a good thing. Living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. In the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job I did in Plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in Exeter by 75p an hour. Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.\\n\\nI work at a large Hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of Â£4.85 as the basic rate. Someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. How dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages? Who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow?\\n\\nThis is definitely the right step in the right direction. It shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. This is a million votes more. Good strategy isn\\'t it?\\n\\nAlthough I would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks. I am quite prepared for a raft of \\'bribes\\' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards, they are playing us for the fools they think we are.\\n\\nThis is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. By increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. The extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the UK, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. The jubilation felt by \"low-paid\" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.\\n\\nThis will only lead to a reduction in jobs. Why have many of the call centre jobs gone to India. Blair say\\'s the economy is \"strong and stable economy\" however consumer debt and the country\\'s debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses, that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.\\n\\nThe timing cannot be coincidental. This is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.\\n\\nAndrew in Derby complains that raising the minimum wage is \\'blatant electioneering\\'. I don\\'t mind if it is. In our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. My only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. If my maths is right, a 35 hour week at Â£5.05 gives you an annual income just over Â£9,000 and raising it to Â£6 leaves it under Â£11,000. The unions should be putting the Government under pressure for much more. Businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.\\n\\nI am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. Also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. We are already seeing a sweeping change in IT work being lost to India where people are paid much less. It is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as \\'sweat shop\\', but now we are told it is global competition. With our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. There has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. The whole picture needs to be looked at.\\n\\nThis is great news, but that might be because I work for minimum wage. Seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. When you can \"earn\" more from claiming than you can from work, there is no incentive. Perhaps a step in the right direction.\\n\\nIf the TUC get their way a very large number of SMEs will have to close - this will put more people out of work. How then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! The government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the SMEs but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. We are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, I am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. As an employee for a small nursery, I know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last October\\'s increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. This latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. If the rate rises to Â£6 then I can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.\\n\\nThe increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. Although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. The raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that I will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and I will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.\\n\\nI currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. Increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses\\n\\nIt is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the \"lower status\" jobs.\\n\\nI know about this great idea - don\\'t bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don\\'t get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn\\'t matter how lazy you are, you\\'ll be guaranteed a decent wage. The ones who suffer are the employers.\\n\\nI hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won\\'t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?\\n\\nI don\\'t believe in the minimum wage at all! I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. Now, before everyone thinks that I am some \"rich-kid\", I can assure you I am not. I came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a Youth Opportunity Program earning Â£25 per week. I worked hard, went to college part time, got my A-levels and degree & bettered myself. I now earn a 6 figure salary. I did that through hard work and getting off my backside. A minimum wage just makes people complacent.\\n\\nTo Ashley, of Swindon: when you earned Â£25 per week, it was worth something. These days that Â£25 would need to be near to Â£60 to have the equivalent buying power. I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages. \"In my day\" type arguments are a view that belong in the \\'your day\\' - 20 years ago!\\n\\nAs a graduate working for minimum wage, I welcome any increase of pay I can get. I disagree with Ashley, Swindon saying I have to work harder to get more pay. I have my GCSE\\'s A-Levels and A degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can\\'t afford the wages I should be getting, I should be on at least 3x what I\\'m getting but they can\\'t afford it. We all work hard but the money is just not there. But on the plus side I love my job and wouldn\\'t change it just to get more pay.\\n\\nAs an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional Â£5000 per year. These next rises will cost me more. I have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. So no one really wins in the end.\\n\\nIn answer to Emma from Sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary Mr Blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher Employer NI Contributions as well. If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the Â£6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. Think of us employers as well Mr Blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.\\n\\nAll workers should be entitled to a fair day\\'s pay for a fair day\\'s work. How many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?\\n\\nIt is good news for many Asians living in UK. Students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. I thank Mr. Blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.\\n',\n",
       " 'Speak easy plan for media players\\n\\nMusic and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them, under plans in development by two US firms.\\n\\nScanSoft and Gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. They want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move. Huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard. \"Voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,\" said Ross Blanchard, vice president of business development for Gracenote. \"These applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,\" he added.\\n\\nGracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as Apple\\'s iTunes. The new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. Users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor\\'s name. \"Speech is a natural fit for today\\'s consumer devices, particularly in mobile environments,\" said Alan Schwartz, vice president of SpeechWorks, a division of ScanSoft. \"Pairing our voice technologies with Gracenote\\'s vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they\\'ve never imagined.\" The two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than English. Users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking: \"What is this?\" Portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with Apple to device interfaces to control the firm\\'s iPod music player. But with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player, voice control would make finding that elusive track by Elvis Presley much easier. The firms gave no indication about whether the iPod, or any other media player, were in mind for the use of the voice control technology. The companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005.\\n',\n",

He is awaiting a second trial after an original conviction was thrown out. \"I\\'m not pleased,\" Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said. \"He will not make another video in my jail.\" Footage for the video was filmed by two crews who had permission to interview C-Murder - one from Court TV and one from a local cable show.\\n\\nBut Mr Lee said he did not know the rapper had filmed the video and made an album behind bars, and said he was fooled into letting the cameras in. The rapper\\'s lawyer Ron Rakosky said: \"The bottom line is, we didn\\'t do anything wrong.\" Mr Rakosky said it was better than C-Murder, real name Corey Miller, \"just sitting there, wasting away\". \"Here\\'s a guy in jail, making constructive use of his time instead of withering away,\" he said. \"He\\'s lost more than three years of his life, locked up for a crime he did not commit.\"\\n\\nBut local group Victims and Citizens Against Crime said he should not be working behind bars. \"He is a suspect in a murder case. I don\\'t think he should be allowed these privileges, especially earning money, until his name is totally cleared,\" the group\\'s president Beverly Siemssen said. In 2003, C-Murder was found guilty of killing a 16-year-old in a nightclub, but that decision was thrown out last April. He is now facing a second trial on a charge of second-degree murder. With two brothers in the group Tru, he had two US top 10 albums in the late 1990s before going solo, when he scored another three top 10 albums.\\n',\n",
       " 'Web logs aid disaster recovery\\n\\nSome of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.\\n\\nBloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. When he created it, the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between India and Pakistan. But in the wake of Sunday\\'s tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.\\n\\nThey wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. \"We started publishing these SMSes,\" says Mr Gupta.\\n\\n\"Morquendi was describing scenes like 1,600 bodies washed up on a shore, and people burying, and burying and burying them. People digging holes with their hands. And this was coming through an SMS message. \"We didn\\'t have visual accounts on radio or on TV, or in the print media.\" Soon, thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendi\\'s first hand accounts. In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. \"She was being swept away,\" Morquendi\\'s message read. \"She grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. She says she watched the water pull her friend away.\" Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi\\'s text message blogs was palpable. \"He was running around, looking for friends, burying bodies, carrying bodies,\" Mr Gupta says of Morquendi. \"I can\\'t even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time. \"He was caught between being a journalist and being a human being.\"\\n\\nOthers blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger who\\'s helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog. She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. \"What we\\'re doing is we\\'re building a resource,\" she says. \"Anyone who says, OK, I want to come and do some work in India, volunteer in India, or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia, this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines, relief agencies, aid agencies, contacts for them etc.\"\\n\\nMs Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. \"Imagine if they had this resource available to them, if there was a disaster, how quickly you could funnel aid in, and get people to help,\" she says. Bloggers in the United States are also getting involved. Ramdhan Yadav Kotamaraja is originally from India, but now lives in Dallas. Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. So, he set up an online payment system on his website. Then, says Mr Kotamaraja, the blogging world found out. \"All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. I\\'d say 70% of the donations came from people I don\\'t know. \"It\\'s simply unbelievable to me, that people that I don\\'t know will come and start donating.\" News spreads quickly on weblogs, a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help. One recruit calls himself Heretic. In one of his latest posts, Heretic asks: \"Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? Ever seen a bus inside a house? \"Well,\" Heretic writes, \"that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?\" He concludes: \"Keep it blogged.\"\\n\\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sella wants Michalak recall\\n\\nFormer France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.\\n\\nSella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date. But he told BBC Sport: \"Michalak is the answer both now and for the future. Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak. \"He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland.\" The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. \"The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,\" said Sella.\\n\\n\"Their only mistakes were that they didn\\'t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.\" Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. \"This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup,\" said Sella, \"which Laporte is doing very well. The French get better every game. \"It\\'s difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. \"But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. \"As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we\\'re not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we\\'re world champions.\"\\n\\nThe majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said \"the win was most important\". \"Winning is all that matters,\" he added. \"Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007.\" France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs. But Sella added: \"People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they\\'ll be focused on that. \"But Ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. It\\'s going to be tough.\"\\n',\n",

It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team,\" said Kerr. \"But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win.\" The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy. Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. \"It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by Damien Duff. Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal.\" Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duff\\'s role in the goal. \"It was great play from Damien,\" said the Tottenham striker.\\n\\n\"I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 Duffer is going to get it in the box. \"Playing three up was something different. Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out. \"The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. It is nice to see young players coming through.\" Man-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to bring Steve Finnan\\'s cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. \"I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights,\" said the Chelsea star. \"I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. \"We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers.

It recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country\\'s second most visited tourist attraction, behind Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Charles Saumarez Smith, the gallery\\'s director, said he was \"delighted\". He said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 September 2001 levels. Mr Saumarez Smith added that the pedestrianisation of Trafalgar Square, where the gallery is located, and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.\\n\\n\"Our 2004 exhibition programme of El Greco, Russian Landscape in the Age of Tolstoy and Raphael: From Urbino to Rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets,\" he said. \"The exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public. \"The expectations of today\\'s visitors are higher than ever and we have kept pace with their demands.\" Mr Saumarez Smith said he was confident the gallery could maintain the attendance. \"With important exhibitions of the work of Caravaggio, Stubbs and Rubens in place for 2005, I am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year,\" he added. The figures were prepared by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva).\\n\\nIt found that the figures had been boosted by an increase in Europeans travelling to the UK on budget airlines. Popular cultural tourist spots such as the Tate Modern and the Natural History Museum all recorded increases of more than 10% in visitor numbers compared with 2003. But for legal or confidentiality reasons some Alva members did not submit figures for 2004, including Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Madame Tussauds and Alton Towers. Alva director Robin Broke said: \"Visits from Western Europe were up by 10% and from North America by some 9% compared to 2003, while numbers from the rest of the world rose 20%. \"European figures were helped by the rapid growth of low-cost flights to Britain from Europe, especially from new EU countries.\"\\n',\n",

The two men faced charges following raids in August on suspected pirates by the FBI. The pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (Â£130,000) fine.\\n\\nIn a statement the US Department of Justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the Direct Connect peer-to-peer network. The piracy group called itself the Underground Network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. Direct Connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. Users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. During its investigation FBI agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 \"sound recordings\" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. The raids were organised under the umbrella of Operation Digital Gridlock which was aimed at fighting \"criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks\". In total, six raids were carried out in August. Five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. The Department of Justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. They also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. The two men are due to be sentenced on 29 April.\\n',\n",

Thousands of flat panel screens - LCDs (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets - have already been sold as \"HD\", but are in fact not able to display HD.\\n\\n\"The UK is the largest display market in Europe,\" according to John Binks, director of GfK, which monitors global consumer markets.\\n\\nBut, he added: \"Of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the UK are capable of getting high-definition.\" There are 74 different devices that are being sold as HD but are not HD-ready, according to Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra. They may be fantastic quality TVs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called DVI or HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. Part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the High Street, say industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit last week. \"We have to be careful about consumer confusion. There is a massive education process to go through,\" said Mr Binks. The industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. Eventually, that will be everyone. The BBC is currently developing plans to produce all its TV output to meet HDTV standards by 2010.\\n\\nPreparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with HD cameras. BSkyB plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive HDTV broadcasts, in time for Christmas. Like its Sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (PVRs). The company will start broadcasts of HDTV programmes, offering them as \"premium channel packages\", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. But the set-top box which receives HDTV broadcasts has to plug into a display - TV set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that HD demands, if HDTV is to be \"real\". By 2010, 20% of homes in the UK will have some sort of TV set or display that can show HD in its full glory.\\n\\nBut it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to \"being digital\". As a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a HD forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. Part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. But it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.\\n\\nFrom next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a \"HD-Ready\" sticker. This also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and HDTV signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. \"The logo is absolutely the way forward,\" said David Mercer, analysts with Strategy Analytics. \"But it is still not appearing on many retail products.\" The industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. \"We can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,\" said Mr Oudendijk. \"There may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months.\" The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is testing different flavours of HD formats to prepare for even better HDTV further down the line. It is similarly concerned that people get the right information on HDTV formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. \"We believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,\" said Phil Laven, technical director for the EBU. The TV display manufacturers want us to watch HD on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the \"true impact\" of HD, they say, although smaller displays suffice. What may convince people to spend money on HD-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across Europe. The prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. LCD prices dropped by 43% in Europe as a whole last year, according to Mr Oudendijk.\\n',\n",
       " 'Chancellor rallies Labour voters\\n\\nGordon Brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.\\n\\nThe chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts. Speaking at Labour\\'s spring conference in Gateshead, Mr Brown claimed the NHS was not safe in Conservative hands. He said Tory plans to cut Â£35bn tax would \"cut deep into public service\".\\n\\nTo a packed audience at Gateshead\\'s Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists. Laying into the Conservative\\'s record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, Â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. \"Never again Tory boom and bust.\\n\\n\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of Â£35bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 Â£60bn more.\" Turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.\\n\\nHe said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to \"the only party trusted with the economy\". It was now a \"party not just of employees, but of employers and managers\", he said. In the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly \"warm\" to Mr Brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. He also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world\\'s poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children\\'s centres and flexibility in maternity leave. The prime minister is to take part later on Saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of Labour\\'s attempt to engage the public in their campaign.\\n',\n",
       " 'Woolf murder sentence rethink\\n\\nPlans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.\\n\\nThere was an outcry three months ago when the Sentencing Guidelines Council - led by Lord Woolf - published its proposals for England and Wales. It had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. But that has now been changed to one-sixth, with no reduction for those killers given a \"whole life tariff\". At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.\\n\\nBut director of the Victims of Crime Trust, Norman Brennan, accused Lord Woolf of having an \"arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public\". The National Association of Probation Officers said the move would be \"political suicide\". In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be \"weighed carefully\" by a judge so they did not lead to \"an inappropriately short sentence\". Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.\\n\\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday Lord Woolf said: \"I have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the SGC has vastly improved the final guidelines. \"I am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending.\" Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the SGC, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. \"What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. \"It represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity,\" he said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Top judge clashes with ministers\\n\\nThe UK\\'s top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen.\\n\\nLord Woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. But he told MPs the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was insisting he should have the final say in such cases. Lord Hutton\\'s inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries.\\n\\nThe government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against Lord Woolf\\'s wishes. Lord Woolf, who is Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee\\'s inquiry into public inquiries. He said he had not been involved in the choice of Lord Hutton, who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction. But he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so, which judge it should be. In written evidence to the committee, Lord Woolf said: \"I have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ... I intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation.\"\\n\\nJudges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on Iraq\\'s weapons of mass destruction, he said. He argued: \"The subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved. \"In addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government.\" He told the MPs: \"Anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me.\"\\n\\nLord Woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns. But that situation could change with new legal reforms. The issue had been \"overlooked\" when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions. \"What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn\\'t happen,\" he said.\\n\\nLord Woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle. A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said Lord Woolf and Lord Falconer agreed about what happened in practice. \"Their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute, in Lord Woolf\\'s words,\" she said. \"As Lord Woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice. \"Judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs.\" Parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.\\n',\n",
       " 'Sir Paul rocks Super Bowl crowds\\n\\nSir Paul McCartney wowed fans with a live mini-concert at American football\\'s Super Bowl - and avoided any Janet Jackson-style controversies.\\n\\nThe 62-year-old sang Hey Jude and other Beatles songs in a 12-minute set at half-time during the game in Florida. Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (Â£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.\\n',\n",
       " 'Jowell confirms casino climbdown\\n\\nTessa Jowell has announced plans to limit the number of new casinos in the UK to 24, in a move branded a \"humiliating retreat\" by the Tories.\\n\\nIt puts an end to plans for up to 40 super casinos, originally outlined in the government\\'s Gambling Bill. Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large. The Culture Secretary said the move showed she listened to critics who feared an explosion in gambling.\\n\\nBut Conservative shadow culture secretary John Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a \"shambles\". \"This announcement is a further humiliating retreat by the government. \"Instead of the initial intention of the gambling bill, to liberalise the rules governing gambling, the bill now imposes a more restrictive regime than exists at present.\" Shares in British casino operators London Clubs International, Rank Group and Stanley Leisure, who had been hoping the bill would pave the way for a big expansion in smaller casinos, fell by between 10 and 25% following the announcement. Ms Jowell\\'s deputy, Richard Caborn, said the government had adopted a cautious approach to the issue, and responded to the concerns raised. \"Limiting the number of regional casinos to eight in the first phase is a cautious move that will allow us to test the impact of a new kind of casino on the levels of problem gambling,\" he said. \"We also believe it\\'s right to apply this same level of caution to small and large casinos.\"\\n\\nHe added that local authorities would still be able to stop new casinos coming to their areas. Church groups welcomed the limit on the number of casinos. Salvation Army spokesman Jonathan Lomax said: \"The proliferation of these casinos on high streets across the country was a real concern and the [three year] trial period, which we think should last at least five years, will enable research into the potentially severe social consequences of an increase in hard and addictive forms of gambling.\" But British British Casino Association Chairman Penny Cobham said her members were \"outraged\" by the decision, which followed a campaign in the Daily Mail newspaper. \"There was never going to be a massive explosion of casinos. Talk of a casino on every High Street was just a scaring tactic.\"\\n',\n",

In The Chorus (Les Choristes), Jugnot plays an inspiring music teacher at a school for troubled boys in 1949. Despite starring in five films in 2004, Depardieu made 3.35m Euros (Â£2.31m) putting him third place in the chart. \"His name [Depardieu] is no longer sufficient to guarantee the success of a film,\" said Le Figaro newspaper. The Chorus, which Jugnot also co-produced, has drawn an audience of nearly nine million people since its release last year.\\n\\nGodzilla star Jean Reno was France\\'s second best-paid actor in 2004, earning 3.55m Euros (Â£2.45m) .

       " 'Web photo storage market hots up\\n\\nAn increasing number of firms are offering web storage for people with digital photo collections.\\n\\nDigital cameras were the hot gadget of Christmas 2004 and worldwide sales of the cameras totalled $24bn last year. Many people\\'s hard drives are bulging with photos and services which allow them to store and share their pictures online are becoming popular. Search firms such as Google are also offering more complex tools for managing personal photo libraries. Photo giants such as Kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print-ordering services. Some services, such as Kodak\\'s Ofoto and Snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. Other sites, such as Pixagogo, charge a monthly fee. Marcus Hawkins, editor of Digital Camera magazine, said: \"As file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. \"People are using their hard drives, backing up on CD and DVD and now they are using online storage solutions.\\n\\n\"They are a place to store pictures, to share their pictures with families and friends and they can print out their photos.\"\\n\\nWhile many of the services are aimed at the amateur and casual digital photographer, other websites are geared up for enthusiasts who want to share tips and information. Photosig is an online community of photographers who can critique each other\\'s work. On Tuesday, Google released free software for organising and finding digital photos stored on a computer\\'s hard drive. The tool, called Picasa, automatically detects photos as they are added to a PC - whether sent via e-mail or transferred from a digital camera.\\n\\nThe software includes tools for restoring colour and removing red eye, as well as sharpening images. Photos can then be uploaded to sites such as Ofoto. Many people use the sites to edit and improve their favourite photographs before ordering prints. Mr Hawkins added: \"The growth area is that you can order your prints online. Friends and family can also access pictures you want them to see and they can print them out too. \"Rather than just a place to dump your pictures, it\\'s about sharing them.\"\\n\\nThe vast majority of pictures remain on a PC\\'s hard drive, which is why search tools, such as those offered by Google, become increasingly important. But some historians and archivists are concerned that the need for perfect pictures will mean that those poor quality prints which offered a tantilising glimpse of the past may disappear forever. \"It\\'s one thing taking pictures, it\\'s another finding them,\" said Mr Hawkins. \"But this is the same problem that has always existed - how many of us have photos in wallets tucked away somewhere?\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Top of the Pops leaves BBC One\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s flagship pop music programme Top of the Pops is to move from BBC One on Fridays to Sundays on BBC Two.\\n\\nThe new programme will combine with archive show TOTP2, mixing new music with footage of classic bands. The corporation said the new show \"aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers\". The move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show, which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on BBC One. Top of the Pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in December last year in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in audience figures.\\n\\nThe All New Top of the Pops was fronted by newcomer Tim Kash and was put together by producer Andi Peters, who was brought back to the BBC from Channel 4 to revitalise the series.\\n\\nAbout three million people a week were watching the show on Fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular ITV soap Coronation Street. But despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. Tim Kash has since been replaced as host by Fearne Cotton. The new show will launch in Spring next year in an extended format. BBC Two controller Roly Keating: \"It\\'s an exciting new era for Top of the Pops. We want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation.\" Mr Keating described BBC Two as the \"natural home\" of Top of the Pops. He added: \"The addition of Top of the Pops will also extend BBC Two\\'s offering to younger audiences.\"\\n\\nA BBC spokeswoman said Andi Peters would continue as executive producer on the show. She said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided. The programme will have a close relationship with the BBC Radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on Sundays. \"Hopefully the audience for Top of the Pops will find it on BBC Two. \"We think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Games enter the classroom\\n\\nVideo games could soon be transplanted from their natural habitat to the more academic atmosphere of the classroom.\\n\\nWith violent titles continuing to top the charts, gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn. Recent research by the London Institute of Education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom. \"Games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving,\" said Martin Owen, at Futurelab. Mr Owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.\\n\\nFuturelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning. Most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but Liverpool-based games firm Lateral Visions saw a gap in the market. \"Learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we didn\\'t see anyone else doing what we wanted to do,\" said Dr Carl Gavin, managing director of Lateral Visions. The company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element. The result is Racing Academy, a massively multiplayer car racing game, which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well.\\n\\nIt is being used by Futurelab to test the viability of using gaming in the classroom. \"We are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational,\" said Mr Owen. Players will have to understand how a car works in order to win races and the knowledge of physics and engineering that they gather along the way will be done in a way that no text book can teach. The game requires users to build and maintain their vehicles and to monitor and analyse performance using data from a variety of outputs, before and after racing. Teamwork is essential and a chat area allows students to exchange information and data, work collaboratively and review their own performances. This fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to Futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks Mr Owen.\\n\\nThe game has been trialled in two secondary schools in Bristol and feedback from students has been positive. \"Pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other,\" said Ben Williamson, a researcher at Futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools. Dr Gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers\\' need for learning outcomes and the children\\'s desire to rise to a challenge. \"Games in the classroom need to support the teacher. It is not about giving children free rein to play game but recognising that games attract attention and offer a challenge,\" he said. Professor Angela MacFarlane, based at Bristol University, has spent several years researching how games can be incorporated into classrooms.\\n\\nUse of games in schools has been patchy she found, with Sim City proving the most popular. Traditionally schools have eschewed mainstream games in favour of used so-called edu-tainment software in a belief that such packages help to make learning fun, she found in her research. \"It is perhaps in a compromise between edutainment and mainstream games that the greatest potential for classroom useable games lies,\" she wrote in a paper entitled Games and Learning. \\'Lite\\' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles - persuading developers to write for the educational market. This would appeal to developers because of the low costs involved in adapting them as well as offering a new opportunity for marketing. Already there are games on the market, such as Civilisation and Age of Empire, that have educational elements said Mr Owen. \"Even in Grand Theft Auto it is not just the violence that engages people,\" he said. It could be some time until that particular game makes it into the classroom though.\\n',\n",

       " 'LSE \\'sets date for takeover deal\\'\\n\\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim.\\n\\nThe Sunday Telegraph said the LSE\\'s plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A Â£1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of Â£1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the Â£1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE\\'s managed bid process.\\n\\nDespite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE\\'s board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming \"increasingly frustrated\" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse\\'s Â£1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE\\'s decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange\\'s offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city\\'s status as Europe\\'s financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator\\'s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse\\'s control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.\\n',\n",

The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\\n\\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\\n\\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\\n\\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\\n\\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK\\'s Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy\\'s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers\\' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson\\'s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones. Over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to September featured integrated cameras, it said.\\n',\n",
       " 'John Peel replacement show begins\\n\\nThe permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel\\'s BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter\\'s slot.\\n\\nRock DJ Huw Stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every Tuesday, with black music champion Ras Kwame on Wednesdays and dance DJ Rob Da Bank on Thursdays. Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October. All three will play \"diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial\" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.\\n\\nRadio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. The three DJs were chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\", the station said.\\n\\nRob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales. And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week.\\n\\nGood luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it\\'s probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed.\\n\\nVery good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations!\\n\\nThe whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq.\\n\\nThe obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com. This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today. Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel. BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.\\n',\n",
       " 'Faultless Federer has no equal\\n\\nRoger Federer - nice bloke, fantastic tennis player - the ultimate sportsman.\\n\\nWhen Lleyton Hewitt shook his hand after getting another thrashing, a third in as many months, the Australian said; \"You\\'re the best.\" How right he is. The stats speak for themselves: 11 titles from 11 finals during 2004 - three of them Grand Slams - and 13 final victories in a row going back to Vienna 2003. That\\'s an open-era record. Hewitt, at times in Houston, showed form which easily matched his Grand Slam-winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. But he was outplayed. Twice. Hewitt, along with Andy Roddick and Marat Safin, is sure to be prominent during 2005. But realistically, all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. According to all those players and even Federer himself, the Swiss star is in a different league.\\n\\n\"Right now I feel that a little bit,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I\\'ve dominated all the top ten players. They say nice things about me because I have beaten them all. I am dominating the game right now and I hope it continues!\" The number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court. He has just been voted, by the International Tennis Writers, as the best \"Ambassador for Tennis\" on the ATP Tour. He has time for everyone. Every match, from first round to final, is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages; English, French and Swiss-German. After a major win, there are extra requests, obligations and interviews, all seen through to the end with courtesy and, most importantly, good humour. \"You guys are funny, I have a good time with you guys,\" he said, genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder. \"I see you pretty much every day on the tour so to give away an hour for interviews is really no problem for me. \"If I can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me. People say thanks back and that is nice.\" What a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade. It sums up his modest personality. Shortly after collecting a Waterford Crystal trophy, a Mercedes convertible and a tasty cheque for $1.5m, Federer addressed the Houston crowd and concluded by saying \"thanks for having me\". Now he just needs to find a way of winning the French Open, the one Grand Slam to so far elude him.\\n',\n",
       " \"Clyde 0-5 Celtic\\n\\nCeltic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.\\n\\nThe home side's Craig Bryson had a goal chopped off before Stan Varga headed Celtic into the lead. Alan Thompson scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Shaun Maloney had been fouled. Stilian Petrov slid in a third, Varga tapped in his second and Craig Bellamy completed the rout with a fine drive. Bryn Halliwell was the busier keeper early on, saving from Bellamy, Chris Sutton and Juninho. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from Bryson, but the referee had already blown for a foul by Petrov. From the resulting free kick, Darren Sheridan curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, Halliwell did well to come off his line and block Bellamy's effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that Stephane Henchoz headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and Halliwell was left floundering as Varga glanced the ball into the net.\\n\\nMaloney replaced the injured Sutton at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by Bryson and Thompson converted the penalty. Sheridan and Bellamy were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. Juninho brought out another good save from Halliwell and then Petrov saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But Petrov and Juninho combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past Halliwell from 12 yards. Varga got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - Thompson whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and Bellamy opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving Aiden McGeady, Jackie McNamara and Maloney culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. Halliwell kept the deficit at five by pushing a McGeady shot wide as the game petered out.\\n\\nHalliwell, Mensing, Bollan, Balmer, Potter, Sheridan (Burns 61), Arbuckle (Gilhaney 61), Gibson, Bryson (Jones 78), Malone, Harty.\\n\\nMorrison, Wilson.\\n\\nMensing, Sheridan.\\n\\nDouglas, Henchoz, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Juninho Paulista, Thompson, Lennon (Lambert 70), Sutton (Maloney 45), Petrov (McGeady 70), Bellamy.\\n\\nMarshall, Laursen.\\n\\nThompson, Bellamy.\\n\\n: Varga 40, Thompson 48 pen, Petrov 60, Varga 68, Bellamy 72.\\n\\n8,200\\n\\nC Thomson\\n\",\n",
       " \"Gizmondo gadget hits the shelves\\n\\nThe Gizmondo combined media player, phone and gaming gadget goes on sale on Saturday.\\n\\nPriced at Â£229, the handheld device is debuting in the UK and goes on sale in the US and mainland Europe in the next few weeks. A catalogue of about 20 games is being prepared for the gadget including The Great Escape and Conflict Vietnam. The British-backed gadget faces stiff competition from handheld gaming devices made by Nintendo and Sony.\\n\\nThe Gizmondo device packs a lot of functions inside its black cover and is aimed at gamers and those that want more from their game-playing gadgets.\\n\\nIt can be used to play games, music tracks and movies. It can take and store digital photos and be used like a mobile phone to send text, multimedia and e-mail messages. The phone service to enable people to send messages is being provided by pre-pay Vodafone accounts bundled in with the device. It also works with GPS (Global Position System) so can also be used as a navigation aid or to support a variety of location-based services. The GPRS and Bluetooth wireless data systems onboard mean that it can be used for multi-player gaming. The gadget will be available from the Gizmondo store on London's Regent Street and from several other retail partners. Although the device rolls together an impressive list of functions, it will face serious competition from three established names in mobile gaming: Nintendo, Nokia and Sony.\\n\\nThe main competition is likely to come from Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo's DS handheld went on sale on 11 March and priced at Â£99 costs far less than the Gizmondo. It also has a ready pool of fans of earlier Nintendo handhelds to draw on. In the first two days it was on sale in Europe the 87,000 DS handhelds were sold - a better debut than the GameCube enjoyed. Sony's PSP was due to make its European debut in March but now this is likely to be delayed by a few months. The PSP is due to go on sale in the US later this month and a bundle including the player, accessories and a copy of Spiderman 2 is expected to cost about $250 (Â£129). The PSP can also play music and movies and supports wireless multiplayer gaming. Nokia's N-Gage could also be a competitor on the telecommunications side. This too crams a fully functional phone into a gadget that also plays games.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Guantanamo pair\\'s passport ban\\n\\nThe government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.\\n\\nA letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the US. This suggested he was likely to take part in action against UK or allied targets if he left Britain, it said. An identical letter has been sent to Feroz Abbasi, the men\\'s solicitor says.\\n\\nIt is not known whether the other two men released from the Cuba detention camp in January - Richard Belmar and Moazzam Begg - have also received letters. The government is implementing the rarely used Royal Prerogative in order to withdraw the men\\'s passports. It is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. The letter, from the Home Office, says: \"I am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the United States, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the United Kingdom, you would take part in activities against the United Kingdom, or allied targets.\"\\n\\nThe Home Office said it could not comment on individual cases.\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.\\n\\nHome Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. He added: \"The power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and I find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time.\" He said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the Royal Prerogative. The Liberal Democrats have promised to raise the issue in Parliament.\\n\\nAmnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on \"torture evidence\" obtained at Guantanamo Bay. \"Furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the UK in the detention of UK residents and nationals and possibly many others at Guantanamo Bay,\" said director Kate Allen. The men\\'s solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy \"condemns and prohibits\" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused. Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001. Mr Mubanga, 29, from north London, was originally detained in Zambia.\\n',\n",
       " 'Edu blasts Arsenal\\n\\nArsenal\\'s Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.\\n\\nEdu\\'s deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told BBC Sport: \"I\\'m not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. \"If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that\\'s made me think.\" Edu\\'s brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal\\'s current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: \"My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.\\n\\n\"There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. \"Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that\\'s in the best interests of both the club and myself. \"I\\'m going to make my decision after the meeting later this week.\" Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: \"I\\'ve just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.\\n\\n\"That\\'s nice, but I\\'ve never talked to them, so I can\\'t say they want me sign 100%.\" Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wenger\\'s support for him. \"I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - he\\'s always said he wants me to sign.\"\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Poll Idols\\' face first hurdles\\n\\nVote For Me - ITV1\\'s Pop Idol style talent contest for would-be politicians - finally hits our screens this week.\\n\\nOver the next four days, hundreds of potential candidates will be whittled down by a panel of experts and public vote. The winner will then be encouraged to stand as an independent at the next general election, which is expected in the spring. But opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics. \"Any of them would make competent MPs,\" former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme.\\n\\nMr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of \"odd balls\" and the show will engage ordinary voters. \"If it gets more people voting and more people interested in politics there is no harm in that,\" he said. But Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher\\'s former press secretary, took a less charitable view, accusing the programme of \"corrupting politics\".\\n\\nHe said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters \"with that bunch of nutters\". To give Sir Bernard his dues, Monday evening\\'s opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. Among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth\\'s birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister. The show follows the time-honoured Pop Idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.\\n\\nThe contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. Then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. They were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with television host Lorraine Kelly taking the Nicki Chapman role. But the real star of the show is Kelvin MacKenzie, in the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty seat.\\n\\nThe former Sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. His advice for one young contestant was to \"get a haircut and a brain transplant\". Wheelchair user Kevin Donnellon was asked: \"Why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?\" \"Don\\'t you care about the Inuit?\", implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner Barry Lim. \"I don\\'t care about them. I care about myself and when the sun\\'s shining I think - fantastic,\" replied Mr MacKenzie.\\n\\nMr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. \"When the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers Mr Brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in Britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,\" observed Mr MacKenzie. \"That was an total disaster. I just couldn\\'t seem to think of things to say,\" a crestfallen Mr Lim confided in the show\\'s presenter, Jonathan Maitland. Irfan Hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from Bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by Mr MacKenzie\\'s suggestion that instead of being treated by the NHS, young drunks should \"given a good beating\" and left to die. Dominic Carman - son of late libel lawyer George Carman - was voted through to the final 25, on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. Opinion was more divided over Rodney Hylton-Potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress. \"He could join the rest of the crooks in the Houses of Parliament.\" But Ms Kelly said she \"would not trust him as far as she could throw him\". The series continues throughout the week, with the public given the chance to evict one prospective MP every night. ITV will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.\\n',\n",
       " 'Water firm Suez in Argentina row\\n\\nA conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas, controlled by France\\'s Suez, is casting doubt on the firm\\'s future.\\n\\nThe firm, which serves the province of Buenos Aires, wants a tariff rise of 60% to fund water-supply improvements. The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; Â£72.3m) in improvements. Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for \"free\".\\n\\nMr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make a contribution \"in the form of a subsidy\".\\n\\nHe has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company\\'s board. He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed. However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board. The Planning Minister didn\\'t rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession. Yet he added that he didn\\'t like to do \"futurology\". But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments. Speaking in Buenos Aires, Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided. Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain\\'s Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%. Recently, Suez lost a water concession in Bolivia after mass protests in the city of El Alto (the poorest in the country), with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. This forced the government to cancel the contract.\\n\\nIn Argentina, Suez\\'s subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government. During the last financial crisis in Argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina. But he has rejected any tariff increases, alleging this will impoverish citizens further. He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract. The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos. The issue has attracted European interest. Last week in Paris, President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac. The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise utilities tariffs, because most of the utilities operating in Argentina are European.\\n',\n",
       " 'Broadband in the UK growing fast\\n\\nHigh-speed net connections in the UK are proving more popular than ever.\\n\\nBT reports that more people signed up for broadband in the last three months than in any other quarter. The 600,000 connections take the total number of people in the UK signing up for broadband from BT to almost 3.3 million. Nationally more than 5 million browse the net via broadband. Britain now has among the highest number of broadband connections throughout the whole of Europe.\\n\\nAccording to figures gathered by industry watchdog, Ofcom, the growth means that the UK has now surpassed Germany in terms of broadband users per 100 people. The UK total of 5.3 million translates into 7.5 connections per 100 people, compared to 6.7 in Germany and 15.8 in the Netherlands. The numbers of people signing up to broadband include those that get their service direct from BT or via the many companies that re-sell BT lines under their own name. Part of the surge in people signing up was due to BT stretching the reach of ADSL - the UK\\'s most widely used way of getting broadband - beyond 6km.\\n\\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line technology lets ordinary copper phone lines support high data speeds. The standard speed is 512kbps, though faster connections are available. \"This breakthrough led to a dramatic increase in orders as we were suddenly able to satisfy the pent-up demand that existed in many areas,\" said Paul Reynolds, chief executive of BT Wholesale which provides phone lines that other firms re-sell. BT Retail, which sells net services under its own name, also had a good quarter and provided about 30% of the new broadband customers. This was a slight increase on the previous three months. Despite the good news about growth in broadband, figures from telecommunications regulator Ofcom show that BT faces increasing competition, and dwindling influence, in other sectors. Local Loop Unbundling, (LLU), in which BT rivals install their hardware in exchanges and take over the line to a customer\\'s home or office, is growing steadily. Cable & Wireless and NTL have announced that they are investing millions to start offering LLU services. By the end of September more than 4.2 million phone lines were using so-called Carrier Pre-Section (CPS) services, such as TalkTalk and One.Tel, which route phone calls across non-BT networks from a local exchange. There are now more than 300 different firms offering CPS services and the percentage of people using BT lines for voice calls has shrunk to 55.4%.\\n',\n",
       " \"Latin America sees strong growth\\n\\nLatin America's economy grew by 5.5% in 2004, its best performance since 1980, while exports registered their best performance in two decades.\\n\\nThe United Nations' Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said the region grew by 5.5% this year. The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) said regional exports reached $445.1bn (Â£227bn;331bn euros) in 2004. Doubts about the strength of the US recovery and overheating of the Chinese economy do however pose risks for 2005. Both organisations also warned that high oil prices raise the risk of either inflation or recession.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) still forecasts growth of 4% for 2005. Strong recovery in some countries, such as Venezuela and Uruguay, boosted the overall performance of the region. ECLAC also said that the six largest Latin American economies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela) grew by more than 3% for only the second time in 20 years. Chinese and US economic strength helped boost exports, as did strong demand for agricultural and mining products. In fact, Latin American exports to China grew 34%, to $14bn. Higher oil prices also helped boost exports, as Mexico and Venezuela are important oil exporters. Regional blocs as well as free trade agreements with the US contributed to the region's strong performance, the IADB said.\\n\",\n",

Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot.\\n\\nPearson\\'s Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters.\\n\\nThe National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. \"Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,\" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. \"They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,\" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.\\n\\nSome broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size.\\n\\nThe Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black\\'s Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods.\\n\\nTelegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.\\n\\n\"Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,\" he said. \"However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital.\" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page.

       " 'Robinson ready for difficult task\\n\\nEngland coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales.\\n\\nRobinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday\\'s set-to with France at Twickenham. Lewis Moody and Martin Corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. And the midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat. Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour. The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out.\\n\\nTait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an \"unforgiving place\" for the teenage prodigy. Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England\\'s future. Tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by Gavin Henson in particular. \"I want more of that definitely,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we\\'ll have to look at the video and wait and see. \"We were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. I thought we defended reasonably well but we\\'ve just got to pick it up for France.\"\\n\\nHis Newcastle team-mate Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test. He missed a tackle on Michael Owen in the build-up to Wales\\' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled Gavin Henson\\'s cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter. His contribution improved in the second half, but England clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. Up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from Chris Jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for Moody. It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way. Lock Ben Kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere England positives were thin on the ground.\\n',\n",

Pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers, canvassers and political candidates. Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said engaging young people\\'s interest was \"essential\" to the future of democracy.\\n\\nHe added: said \"Young people who are engaged and motivated by the political process are essential to the future health of our democracy. \"The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters. \"By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future.\" The Hansard Society, the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills are running the programme. Pupils will stand as party candidates, speech writers and canvassers. Michael Raftery, project manager at the Hansard Society, said: \"The Y Vote Mock Elections for schools mirror the excitement and buzz of a real election, raising awareness of citizenship, and the benefits of active democracy.\" The mock votes will take place around 5 May, widely expected to be the date of the general election. Information packs, including ballot papers and manifesto guides, with elections happening in early May were sent out to the 3,000 schools invited to take part.\\n',\n",

The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver profits despite the failure of an obesity drug. Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said it had been a \"difficult year\".\\n\\nIn early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at 1218 pence. Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over Â£1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business. \"The continuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a good performance in 2005,\" he said. \"2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress.\" However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as \\'771, after disappointing clinical trial results.

       " 'Muslims discuss election concerns\\n\\nIssues that Muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by UK community representatives.\\n\\nThe event is being held by the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB), which believes Muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies. Last year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections. But a spokesman stressed the meeting was \"not necessarily anti-Labour\". \"This meeting is not anti-party in particular, it\\'s anti-policy, it\\'s on the issues we are going to ask Muslims to vote on,\" MAB spokesman Dr Azzam Tamimi said of Tuesday\\'s event.\\n\\n\"There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.\" Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.\\n\\nApproximately 1.1m of the UK\\'s 1.6m Muslims are of voting age. Previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted Labour, but more recent studies have suggested Labour support has been falling away significantly among some Muslim voters.\\n\\nAnger over the war in Iraq has appeared to be the main reason, with many saying it was \"unjustified\". Representatives from a number of Muslim organisations will attend Tuesday\\'s event. Among them will be the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The chairman of the MCB\\'s public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims\\' voting intentions. \"I think it\\'s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact,\" Mr Khan said.\\n\\nHowever, Professor John Curtice, of the University of Strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by Muslims could make. \"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there\\'s a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\\n\\nThe constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added. In Bethnal Green, former Labour MP George Galloway, who founded the anti-war party Respect, is standing against sitting MP Oona King, who had a 10,000-vote majority in 2001. In Rochdale, the Liberal Democrats - the mainstream party a 2004 ICM survey showed was benefiting most from Muslim disaffection with Labour - secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than Labour\\'s Lorna Fitzsimons. But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box. \"Ironically the Tories might be the beneficiaries if Labour does lose seats, which is generally the case,\" he said. But Dr Tamimi said MAB\\'s intention was not to \"empower\" the Tories. \"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly. \"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that\\'s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.\\n',\n",
       " 'Have hackers recruited your PC?\\n\\nMore than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.\\n\\nThe huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely-controlled machines. The largest network of so-called zombie networks spied on by the team was made up of 50,000 hijacked home computers. Data was gathered using machines that looked innocent but which logged everything hackers did to them.\\n\\nThe detailed look at zombie or \\'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the Honeynet Project - a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as \"honey pots\" to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. While \\'bot nets have been known about for some time, estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.\\n\\nTo gather its information the German arm of the Honeynet Project created software tools to log what happened to the machines they put on the web. Getting the machines hijacked was worryingly easy. The longest time a Honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes. The shortest compromise time was only a few seconds. The research found that, once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on IRC servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. Many well-known vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system were exploited by \\'bot net controllers to find and take over target machines. Especially coveted were home PCs sitting on broadband connections that are never turned off.\\n\\nThe months of surveillance revealed that the different \\'bot nets - which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines - are used for a variety of purposes. Many are used as relays for spam, to route unwanted adverts to PC users or as launch platforms for viruses. But the research team found that many are put to very different uses. During the monitoring period, the team saw \\'bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial-of-service attacks on 99 separate targets. These attacks bombard websites with data in an attempt to overwhelm the target. Using a \\'bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against. One DDoS attack was used by one firm to knock its competitors offline. Other \\'bot nets were used to abuse the Google Adsense program that rewards websites for displaying adverts from the search engine. Some networks were used to abuse or manipulate online polls and games. Criminals also seem to be starting to use \\'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. \"Leveraging the power of several thousand bots, it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly,\" said the researchers. \"Even in unskilled hands, it should be obvious that \\'bot nets are a loaded and powerful weapon.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Q&A: Malcolm Glazer and Man Utd\\n\\nThe battle for control of Manchester United has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from US business tycoon Malcolm Glazer.\\n\\nNo formal offer has been made yet, but Manchester United have confirmed they have received a \"detailed proposal\" from the US entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. Reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value Manchester United at about Â£800m ($1.5bn). The approach by the 76-year-old owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, Avi and Joel. A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. However, the BBC has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.\\n\\nMr Glazer\\'s previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. That would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by Manchester United\\'s board when they rejected his approach last year. However, Mr Glazer\\'s latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by Â£200m.\\n\\nWhile United\\'s board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer\\'s latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.\\n\\nSupporters\\' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer\\'s campaign - said it would fight any move. \"Manchester United are a debt-free company. We don\\'t want to fall into debt and we don\\'t need to fall into debt,\" Shareholders United\\'s Sean Bones told the BBC. United\\'s players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"A lot of people want the club\\'s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" Rio Ferdinand told BBC Radio Five Live. \"No-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"\\n\\nThe key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of United\\'s largest shareholders, the Irish horse racing tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus. Through their Cubic Expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Joe McLean, a football specialist at accountancy firm Grant Thornton, said the support of Mr Magnier and Mr McManus was \"utterly crucial\". \"Mr Glazer\\'s bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"If that\\'s the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"If that\\'s the case then Mr Glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"\\n\\nIndeed it is. Malcolm Glazer was little-known in the UK until he started to build up his stake in Manchester United in late 2003. In February 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. At the club\\'s annual general meeting in November, Mr Glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. Legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive David Gill. But the move led to bankers JP Morgan and public relations firm Brunswick withdrawing from the Glazer bid team.\\n',\n",

They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men\\'s 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women\\'s 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic\\'s governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. \"I am confident and optimistic,\" Thanou had said at the time. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\" It was not clear what this new evidence was.\\n',\n",

       " 'New consoles promise big problems\\n\\nMaking games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.\\n\\nSony, Microsoft and Nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual E3 games Expo in Los Angeles in May. These so-called \"next generation\" machines will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. For gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. In a pre-recorded video slot during Microsoft\\'s keynote address at the Game Developers Conference, held last week in San Francisco, famed director James Cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be Battle Angel Alita. The game\\'s visual quality would be \"like a lucid dream,\" said Mr Cameron. But numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. The first new console, Microsoft\\'s Xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. Games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today.\\n\\nAccording to Robert Walsh, head of Brisbane-based game developer Krome Studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. Such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said Mr Walsh. \"If you\\'re a start-up, I doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,\" he said. Mr Walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the Sony PSP and the Nintendo DS, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.\\n\\nOne developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is Will Wright, the creator of the best-selling The Sims games. The founder of California\\'s Maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, Spore. Spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. Starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.\\n\\nEventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. Advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other Spore players. These worlds will be automatically swapped across the Internet. Mr Wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. \"I don\\'t want to put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins - I want them to be George Lucas or Dr Seuss,\" explained Mr Wright. Few games have hinted at the scope of Spore, but Mr Wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. Instead of employing lots of artists to create 3D models of the digital creatures, Spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. \"The thing I am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market,\" said Mr Wright. \"I\\'d like to offer an alternative to that.\"\\n\\nNew development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.\\n\\nOxford-based Natural Motion launched Endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3D \\'virtual actor\\'. The actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. Endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. Artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in their games. The process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. Another British company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is Manchester start-up Genemation. Its latest tool, GenCrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. GenCrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. The software can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour.\\n\\nOne area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. Even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.\\n\\nThe Game Developers Conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. A niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago, GDC\\'s Mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. Mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. Furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. It\\'s predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. The growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by John Batter, general manager at EA Mobile. EA Mobile is a division of Electronic Arts, the biggest games publisher. Until recently Electronic Arts had been dismissive of games for phones. \"The last time you checked, EA wasn\\'t in this business,\" Mr Batter admitted. But he said EA now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. EA plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. The first will be a version of its Need for Speed racing game, created by EA Mobile\\'s 30-person development team. Mr Batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on Sony\\'s upcoming PSP handheld console.\\n\\nOwain Bennallack is the editor of Develop magazine.\\n',\n",
       " 'Economy \\'stronger than forecast\\'\\n\\nThe UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax.\\n\\nPrivate sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. Official data comes from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Though reliable, ONS data takes longer to publish, so now the BoE is calling for faster delivery of data so it can make more effective policy decisions. \"Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available,\" Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club.\\n\\nThe ONS is due to publish its second estimate of third quarter growth on Friday. \"The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate,\" Ms Lomax said. The Bank said successful monetary policy depends on having good information. Rachel Lomax cited the late 1980s as an example of a time when weak economic figures were published, but substantially revised upwards years later.\\n\\n\"The statistical fog surrounding the true state of the economy has proved a particularly potent breeding ground for policy errors in the past,\" she said. Improving the quality of national statistics is the single the best way of making sure the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) makes the right decisions, she said. The Bank of England is working in tandem with the ONS to improve the quality and speed of delivery of data. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target.\\n\\nA slowdown in the housing market and this year\\'s surge in oil prices has made economic forecasting all the more tricky, leading to a more uncertain outlook. \"This year rising oil prices and a significant slowdown in the housing market have awoken bad memories of the 1970s and 1980s,\" Ms Lomax said. \"The MPC will be doing well if it can achieve the same stability over the next decade as we have enjoyed over the past 10 years.\" Decisions on interest rates are made after the MPC gathers together the range of indicators available every month. The clearest signals come when all indicators are pointing the same direction, Ms Lomax intimated. \"In economic assessment, there is safety in numbers.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'ECB holds rates amid growth fears\\n\\nThe European Central Bank has left its key interest rate unchanged at 2% for the 19th month in succession.\\n\\nBorrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said. Despite signs of pick-up, labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish, while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies. High oil prices, meanwhile, have put upward pressure on the inflation rate.\\n\\nSurveys of economists have shown that the majority expect borrowing costs to stay at 2% in coming months, with an increase of a quarter of a percentage point predicted some time in the second half of the year. If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar. \"The euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery,\" said economist Dirk Schumacher. The ECB \"may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will.\" Data coming out of Germany on Thursday underlined the problems facing European policy makers. While Germany\\'s economy expanded by 1.7% in 2004, growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year.\\n\\nThe strength of the euro is threatening to dampen that foreign demand in 2005, and domestic consumption currently is not strong enough to take up the slack. Inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in December, above ECB guidelines of 2%. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005. The ECB has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.\\n',\n",

At the same time, retail sales picked up faster than at any time since 1997. The news sent Tokyo shares to an eight-month high, as investors hoped for a recovery from the three quarters of contraction seen from April 2004 on. The Nikkei 225 index ended the day up 0.7% at 11,740.60 points, with the yen strengthening 0.7% against the dollar to 104.53 yen. Weaker exports, normally the engine for Japan\\'s economy in the face of weak domestic demand, had helped trigger a 0.1% contraction in the final three months of last year after two previous quarters of shrinking GDP. Only an exceptionally strong performance in the early months of 2004 kept the year as a whole from showing a decline. The output figures brought a cautiously optimistic response from economic officials. \"Overall I see a low risk of the economy falling into serious recession,\" said Bank of Japan chief Toshihiko Fukui, despite warning that other indicators - such as the growth numbers - had been worrying.\\n\\nWithin the overall industrial output figure, there were signs of a pullback from the export slowdown. Among the best-performing sectors were key overseas sales areas such as cars, chemicals and electronic goods. With US growth doing better than expected the picture for exports in early 2005 could also be one of sustained demand. Electronics were also one of the keys to the improved domestic market, with products such as flat-screen TVs in high demand during January.\\n',\n",

The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.\\n\\nMr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (Â£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace.\\n\\nIn the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yoran\\'s division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day\\'s notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. \"Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department\\'s cybersecurity program,\" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation.

The new technology will be welcomed by Hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from DVD sales.\\n\\nThe film industry has stepped up efforts to fight DVD piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of DVD movies for download.\\n\\n\"Ultimately, we see RipGuard DVD... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow\\'s digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,\" said Steve Weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of Macrovision\\'s Entertainment Technologies Group. Macrovision said RipGuard was designed to plug the \"digital hole\" that was created by so-called DeCSS ripper software. It circumvents Content Scrambling System measures placed on DVDs and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted DVDs in minutes. Those copies could then be burned onto a blank DVD or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. Macrovision said RipGuard would also prevent against \"rent, rip and return\" - where people would rent a DVD, copy it and then return the original. RipGuard is expected to be rolled out on DVDs from the middle of 2005, the company said. The new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. Macrovision has said that Rip Guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.\\n',\n",
       " 'Further rise in UK jobless total\\n\\nThe UK\\'s jobless total rose for the second month in a row in December, official figures show.\\n\\nThe number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November\\'s 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.\\n\\nThe apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK\\'s jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, \"it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates\".\\n',\n",
       " 'Soaring oil \\'hits world economy\\'\\n\\nThe soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world\\'s major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.\\n\\nIn its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world\\'s main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.\\n\\nForecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. \"There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,\" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD\\'s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.\\n\\nA dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. \"The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,\" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC\\'s World Business Report. \"The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.\" China\\'s booming economy and a \"spectacular comeback\" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. \"Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,\" it added. However, the report warned: \"It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.\" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone\\'s over-reliance on export-led growth.\\n',\n",

His time at La Fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. He fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for Jules Massenet\\'s Manon last week.\\n\\nHe conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the Berlin Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra. Viotti was born in Switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the Lausanne Conservatory. His career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the Gino Marinuzzi conducting competition in Italy. Viotti established himself as chief conductor of the Turin Opera and went on to become chief conductor of Munich\\'s Radio Orchestra. At La Fenice Viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the French composer Massenet\\'s Thais and some of his other productions included Giuseppe Verdi\\'s La Traviata and Richard Strauss\\'s Ariadne auf Naxos.\\n\\nThe last opera he directed at La Fenice was Massenet\\'s Le Roi de Lahore. Viotti\\'s debut at the New York\\'s Metropolitan Opera came in 2000 with Giacomo Puccini\\'s Madame Butterfly, followed by La Boheme, La Traviata and Fromental Halevy\\'s La Juive. Giampaolo Vianello, superintendent of the Fenice Theatre Foundation, said: \"I am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre.\" Viotti\\'s last public performance was on 5 February when he conducted Vincenzo Bellini\\'s Norma at the Vienna State Opera.\\n',\n",
       " 'US gives foreign firms extra time\\n\\nForeign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 July 2006. Many foreign firms had protested that the SEC was imposing an unfair burden. The new rules are the result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, part of the US clean-up after corporate scandals such as Enron and Worldcom. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules. Big US firms already have to meet the requirements, but smaller ones and foreign-based firms which list their shares on US stock markets originally had until the middle of this year.\\n\\nOver the past few months, delegations of European and other business leaders have been heading to the SEC\\'s Washington DC headquarters to protest. They say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some, particularly the UK\\'s CBI, warned that companies would choose to let their US listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. The latest delegation from the CBI met SEC officials on Wednesday, just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. \"I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC,\" CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC\\'s Today programme. \"They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they can\\'t make these rules in isolation.\" The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. The European Union, in particular, was imposing new international financial reporting standards in 2005, it noted. \"I don\\'t underestimate the effort (compliance) will require... but this extension will provide additional time for those issuers to take a good hard look at their internal controls,\" said Donald Nicolaisen, the SEC\\'s chief accountant.\\n',\n",
       " \"Blinx sequel purrs nicely\\n\\nThe original Blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to Microsoft's then new Xbox console.\\n\\nIts sharp graphics and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast-forward time, were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. But poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half-way through a level without the required tools to finish. Thankfully, the sequel has fixed many of the original faults. This time around you do not play as Blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters.\\n\\nThe character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game.\\n\\nAs the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters. The thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing Time Crystal. As in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space. There are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress. The control over space and time is achieved through a number of VCR-style icons and is quite intuitive.\\n\\nAnnoyingly, the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them. The game has also tried to emulate franchises such as Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank on PS2 and so there are a number of combat elements. These are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair. But the game's excellent graphics, easily the best-looking platform game around, sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans.\\n\\nBlinx 2 is out on Xbox now.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Police urge pub closure power\\n\\nNew powers are needed to close disorderly pubs, bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently, police chiefs have told MPs.\\n\\nAssociation of Chief Police Officers president Chris Fox said the current 24-hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. Mr Fox\\'s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock. He rejected critics\\' calls for the law change to be delayed. Instead, the new Licensing Act could help reduce drunken disorder - but only if it was properly planned, he argued.\\n\\nAcpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the Commons home affairs select committee. After the meeting, Mr Fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact. \"If it\\'s 12.30 on a Saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there\\'s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn\\'t open on Sunday anyway.\\n\\n\"This is about getting through to the management that they can\\'t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions.\" Under Acpo\\'s proposal, the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority. The new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs - but only for 24-hour periods.\\n\\nMr Fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself. \"It\\'s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse, and the strategic planning process has been less than useless,\" he said. Mr Fox said the new laws, due to start being phased in next month, could help if food outlets, public transport and public toilets could cope with late-night drinkers. \"Staggering it (closing hours) will be a solution if the infrastructure is there, if the premises are properly managed and people aren\\'t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street,\" he said. \"We have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event. We have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this.\"\\n\\nAcpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs. Home Secretary Charles Clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing. The licensing changes have sparked concern among some MPs, councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems. Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell on Tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes. It was the status quo, not the new laws, which were causing current binge drinking problems, she told BBC Two\\'s Newsnight. Leaked documents have suggested ex-Home Secretary David Blunkett branded new opening hours as a \"leap in the dark\". But Ms Jowell insisted his concerns had been met. The police\\'s job against alcohol-related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time, she added.\\n',\n",
       " 'GM in crunch talks on Fiat future\\n\\nFiat will meet car giant General Motors (GM) on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm\\'s loss-making auto group.\\n\\nFiat claims that GM is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; GM says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid. Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.\\n\\nThe meeting between Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and GM\\'s Rick Wagoner is due to take place at 1330 GMT in Zurich, according to the Reuters news agency.\\n\\nMr Marchionne is confident of his firm\\'s legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM\\'s argument \"has no legs\". The agreement in question dates back to GM\\'s decision to buy 20% of Fiat\\'s auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a \\'put option\\', to sell the remaining stake to GM. In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this \\'put\\' is still valid and legally binding. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM\\'s holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.\\n\\nSelling the Fiat\\'s car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to Italy\\'s industrial heritage. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. \"We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,\" brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. \"As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. \"Fiat may be willing to cancel the \\'put\\' in exchange for money.\"\\n',\n",

I\\'ve had surgery and after, I got to the Wimbledon final.

Music mogul Tony Wilson, who headed the record company Joy Division were signed to, will be co-executive producer. The musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the US. Mr Wilson, who has remained friends with Curtis\\'s widow and daughter Natalie, who he says asked for his involvement to make the film \"official\". \"People have different ideas as to why Ian committed suicide, so maybe the film will reflect those different views,\" he told the BBC News website.\\n\\nPlans for a separate Joy Division film had been announced at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but the project did not get off the ground as it failed to get the backing of Curtis\\'s family. Mr Wilson, who was also involved with Joy Division\\'s sucessor band New Order, as well as the Happy Mondays, said he would \"rather not\" appear in the film. He made a cameo appearance in 24 Hour Party People, in which his leading role was played by Steve Coogan. \"I\\'m not an actor and I did a lousy job playing my part in 24 Hour Party People,\" said the Factory Records founder, who has been associated with the Manchester music scene since the 1970s. \"Film people have a tendency to mess up when they touch music, but I hope this one works.\\n\\n\"This is much more than the music - they want to do the real story of Ian,\" he said.

       " 'Could Yukos be a blessing in disguise?\\n\\nOther things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.\\n\\nBut in the looking-glass world of modern Russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. The study, from the Centre for Economic Policy Research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company Yukos. But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. \"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.\\n\\nThe paper\\'s reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. In the West, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.\\n\\nAfter Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.\\n\\nSince then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year. After Mr Putin came to power, the company\\'s overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and Sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. But shareholders benefited hugely: Sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.\\n\\nDoes this analysis make sense? In part, certainly. For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. Companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. Foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in Europe. But the authors\\' model does not quite cover all the complexities. For a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. In fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in Russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. Companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.\\n\\nAnd the authors\\' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western. Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. The case against Yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. As far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing Yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. Since Yukos\\' founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the Russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.\\n',\n",

It\\'s the same for everyone but we need to manage it. \"If five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,\" he told BBC Sport. Unless the authorities agree to make changes, Saint-Andre believes England\\'s national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals. \"That\\'s not good for the politics of the English team or for English rugby,\" he argues. It is an issue he has taken up before, most notably during the autumn internationals when Sale lost all three Zurich Premiership matches they played.\\n\\nNow he fears it could derail the club\\'s hopes of cup silverware after eight players, including captain Jason Robinson and fly-half Charlie Hodgson, were away with their countries. \"We\\'re in the quarter-finals, it\\'s always better to play at home than away and it\\'s a great opportunity,\" he added. \"But we have to be careful. Bath have just been knocked out of Europe and will make it a tough game. It also comes at the end of a very, very difficult week. \"Sebastien Bruno\\'s been with France, Jason White with Scotland and there are six with England, that\\'s eight players plus injuries - 13 players out of a squad of 31. \"We\\'ll have just one session together and will have to do our best to make that a good one on Thursday afternoon.\"\\n\\nGloucester have also been caught in a club-versus-country conflict after England sought a second medical opinion on James Simpson-Daniel\\'s fitness.

Anders Svensson and Matt Oakley are likely replacements with Kevin Phillips also scheduled to start, with Henri Camara rested.\\n\\n- Brentford boss Martin Allen: \"After conceding eight goals in our last three matches, I have to admit I\\'m not very confident. \"There\\'s no doubt we\\'re the underdogs and after defending so poorly recently it\\'s not looking good. \"Southampton have just drawn with the Premiership champions and that makes our task harder than it was already.\" \\n - Southampton boss Harry Redknapp: \"We know they can give us problems. \"Brentford have done well but we are the Premiership side and should have the better players. \"Staying in the Premiership is our priority.

They\\'re on their best run in the competition since reaching the quarter-finals for the fourth time in their history 16 years ago. Now they have the carrot of the plum draw in the last eight dangling before them. Victory over Premiership strugglers Southampton, would bring the mighty Manchester United to Griffin Park and a gigantic pay day for the sole League One survivors. \\n - Martin Allen\\'s brave side came back from two goals down at St Mary\\'s to earn a deserved replay. Southampton striker Henri Camara scored twice from close range to put the Saints in command, but Isaiah Rankin hit back just before half time, and Sam Sodje headed past a creaky defence on 58 minutes. \\n - The Londoners have conceded six goals in their two subsequent League outings - three each in losing away to Hartlepool and drawing at home to Sheffield Wednesday. But they haven\\'t lost in six League and Cup games on home turf - winning three and drawing three since the reverse to Torquay on Boxing Day. \\n - SOUTHAMPTON go into this tie on the back of an eventful Premiership match with Arsenal on Saturday. An angry David Prutton pushed referee Alan Wiley after being shown the red card, but his side still came back to draw 1-1. It was Saints\\' fourth stalemate in succession in all competitions, but didn\\'t lift them out of the relegation zone. The retention of their ever present Premier League status must be the number one priority, irrespective of the rewards that success against Brentford would bring. \\n - Victory here would set up a repeat of the 1976 final, when Saints astounded the football world by defeating Tommy Docherty\\'s Manchester United courtesy of Bobby Stokes\\' famous winner. They also knocked out the Red Devils in 1991 on penalties in the fourth round. But to write another chapter in their FA Cup history, the Solent side must avoid succumbing to lower division opposition for the first time since Rotherham, from the second level, beat them 2-1 in a third round tie at Millmoor on 16 January 2002.

       " 'Labour attacked on Howard poster\\n\\nLabour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.\\n\\nThe poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: \"I can spend the same money twice.\" The image prompted concern from the editor of the Jewish Chronicle but Labour insists it is simply anti-Tory. Labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. The party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a blackboard reading: \"2+2=5\".\\n\\nThe hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members. It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs. Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday. Instead, he pointed to how Tony Blair had in 1997 complained about \"personalised abusive campaigning\". Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn\\'t practise what he preaches.\"\\n\\nJewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. \"Shylock and Fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World At One. \"Whatever the idea is, I think it\\'s a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning.\" Mr Temko said he blamed \"cock-up not conspiracy\", saying he did not detect inherent anti-Semitism in any of the parties\\' election campaigns.\\n\\nThe poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. Labour MP Louise Ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-Semitic when they only challenged Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued. \"Concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but I would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the Tories are trying to con you.\" A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party\\'s website was not affected by the row. \"This has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,\" he said. But a Conservative spokeswoman said: \"This poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by Labour\\'s campaign team.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Donor attacks Blair-Brown \\'feud\\'\\n\\nThe reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds.\\n\\nDuncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its \"poor\" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour Â£50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs.\\n\\nThe 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives.\\n\\nRobert Peston\\'s new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: \"Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. \"Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition.\" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq.\\n\\nAnd he branded the UK government\\'s response to the tsunami as \"piecemeal and poor\". \"The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,\" he said. \"The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more.\" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon\\'s Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt.\\n\\nIn a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown\\'s prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour\\'s election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not \"perceived as a problem by the voters,\" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was \"not an alternative source of opposition to the government\". He warned the \"Abstentions Party\" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair\\'s promise to produce an \"unremittingly New Labour\" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain\\'s biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.\\n',\n",
       " 'Concern over RFID tags\\n\\nConsumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency ID (RFID) tags in shops, a survey says.\\n\\nMore than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. The survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in Europe was low. The survey of consumers in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands was carried out by consultancy group Capgemini. The firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of RFID technology. The tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.\\n\\nMore than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that RFID tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. Fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that RFID tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. Ard Jan Vetham, Capgemini\\'s principal consultant on RFID, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about RFID before it would become accepted technology. \"Acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. \"With the right RFID approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point.\" He said that the survey also showed people would accept RFID if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. The tags are currently being used at one Tesco distribution centre in the UK - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. They are also in use as a passcard for the M6 Toll in the Midlands, in the UK. Mr Vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that RFID tags could be read from a distance. He said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. At least once consumer group - Consumers Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (Caspian) - has claimed that RFID chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. All kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.\\n',\n",

But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n\\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n\\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday. The decision also saw Clint Eastwood get his third personal nomination for Million Dollar Baby. He is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. The Academy Awards ceremony will be held in Hollywood on 27 February. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, star of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Hero and House of Flying Daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.\\n\",\n",

Directed by John Carpenter, it made over $60m (Â£31.3m) worldwide - a record for independent film at that time. Hill also worked with Carpenter on Escape From New York and The Fog. Born in New Jersey, Hill began her career as a production assistant and worked her way through the ranks, becoming an assistant director and second-unit director before she began collaborating with Carpenter.\\n\\nShe was regarded by many as a pioneering woman in film, taking on jobs in the 70s that were more commonly taken by men. \"Back when I started in 1974, there were very few women in the industry,\" she said in 2003. \"I was assumed to be the make-up and hair person, or the script person. I was never assumed to be the writer or producer.\" \"I took a look around and realised there weren\\'t that many women, so I had to carve a niche for myself.\" Carpenter said that working with Hill was \"one of the greatest experiences of my life\". \"The ground that she trailblazed in the beginning can now be followed by anyone. She was incredibly capable and talented,\" he said. Carpenter and Hill collaborated on a number of Halloween sequels, including Halloween II, Halloween: Resurrection and Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.\\n\\nLater in her career, Hill formed a production company with her friend Lynda Obst, making a string of hit films including Oscar nominee The Fisher King and teen comedy Adventures In Babysitting. Other films included the Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone in 1983 and 1985\\'s Clue, a comedy based on the board game Cluedo. In the 90s she pursued work in TV, although she was reunited with Carpenter in 1996 for Escape From LA, the sequel to Escape From New York. At the time of her death she was working on a film about the last two men pulled from the rubble of the Twin Towers following the 11 September terror attacks in 2001. She was also co-producing the remake of The Fog, which is due for release early next year.\\n',\n",

The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony\\'s PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. \"We actually believe people who buy the UMD would not have bought it on DVD,\" he said. \"There are people who will want UMD because of the portability.

       " 'BBC poll indicates economic gloom\\n\\nCitizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a BBC World Service poll believe the world economy is worsening.\\n\\nMost respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. But when asked about their own family\\'s financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster. The poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. Those surveyed in three countries were split. In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. Similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. And 47% saw their family\\'s economic conditions improving, as against 36% who said they were getting worse.\\n\\nThe poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm GlobeScan, together with the Program on International Policy Attitudes (Pipa) at the University of Maryland. \"While the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,\" said Pipa director Steven Kull. \"People around the world are saying: \\'I\\'m OK, but the world isn\\'t\\'.\" There may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the BBC\\'s Elizabeth Blunt.\\n\\nThe countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, China and India, followed by Indonesia. China has seen two decades of blistering economic growth, which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale, says the BBC\\'s Louisa Lim in Beijing. But the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country\\'s rosy economic future, our correspondent says. South Korea was the most pessimistic, while respondents in Italy and Mexico were also quite gloomy. The BBC\\'s David Willey in Rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001, which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. The Philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents\\' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. The interviews took place between 15 November 2004 and 5 January 2005. The margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country. In eight of the countries, the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\\n',\n",

Bosworth, 21, plays Darin\\'s wife - real life Hollywood actress Sandra Dee. \"I knew absolutely nothing about Bobby Darin before this film, but now I\\'m a huge fan,\" said Bosworth, who attended the premiere with British boyfriend Orlando Bloom.\\n\\n\"There is darkness and tragedy in the story, and it was a dream for me to land this part.\" Actress Sandra Dee continues to live in Los Angeles as a virtual recluse, but has given her approval to the biopic.\\n\\n\"She called me last week and said she loved it,\" said Spacey, who was joined at the premiere by members of the boy band Westlife.

The voice behind Mack the Knife, Dream Lover and Beyond the Sea, fought childhood illness to become one the biggest stars of the 1950s, but died aged 37 from the heart condition that had troubled him all his life. \"Bobby Darin was one of the greatest entertainers the world has ever known, and yet, because he died young, he\\'s been kind of forgotten,\" said Spacey at the premiere. \"Making this film was the most fun I\\'ve ever had in my entire life.\" The movie also stars British actors Bob Hoskins and Brenda Blethyn, as Darin\\'s mother.\\n',\n",
       " 'Halo fans\\' hope for sequel\\n\\nXbox video game Halo 2 has been released in the US on 9 November, with a UK release two days later. Why is the game among the most anticipated of all time?\\n\\nHalo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. A science fiction epic, Halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. Remembrance of Things Past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as Larry Niven\\'s Ringworld and the film Starship Troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. Halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using Dolby Digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics.\\n\\nBut what marked Halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.\\n\\nProduced by Bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by Microsoft and became an Xbox exclusive. Claude Errera, editor of fansite Halo.Bungie.Org, said: \"Bungie got everything right. They were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. \"Nothing distracts you when you were playing. There was nothing in Halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be.\" He added: \"Graphically it was superior to everything else out there.\\n\\n\"It also had a depth to it that made it stand out.\" Halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. It also capitalised on the growing popularity of LAN gaming in the PC world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.\\n\\nThe game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of Halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, Halo 2. Errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from Halo fans eager for the latest news.\\n\\nWhen the Xbox launched on November 15 2001 in the US, Halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. \"Halo is the most important launch game for any console ever,\" wrote the influential Edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. The game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. \"The first time I played it I just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun,\" said Errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game.\\n\\nThe game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. \"It blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of Halo,\" said Errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of Master Chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. Video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game\\'s amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. Speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. When early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. Errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. \"It does not feel like a game release any more. Somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in Microsoft\\'s history. \"We\\'re all just hoping that Bungie has got it right again.\"\\n\\nHalo 2 is out on 9 November in the US and 11 November in the UK\\n',\n",

A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, Eddie O'Sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.\\n\\nIf that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson's searing break and Andy Craig's pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. Stuart Grimes pulled down O'Kelly at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.\\n\\nO'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O'Gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. O'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.\\n\\nScotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. O'Gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. Stuart Grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. Peter Stringer and O'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.\\n\\n: C Paterson; S Danielli, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; J White, A Hogg, J Petrie.\\n\\nR Russell, B Douglas, N Hines, J Dunbar, M Blair, G Ross, B Hinshelwood.\\n\\nG Murphy; G Dempsey, S Horgan, K Maggs, D Hickie, R O'Gara, P Stringer; R Corrigan, S Byrne, J Hayes, M O'Kelly, P O'Connell, S Easterby, J O'Connor, A Foley.\\n\\nF Sheahan, M Horan, D O'Callaghan, E Miller, G Easterby, D Humphreys, G Duffy.\\n\\nJoel Jutge (France)\\n\",\n",

The Adam Smith Lecture celebrates the author of 1776\\'s Wealth of Nations, which became a bible of capitalism. Dr Greenspan was invited by Chancellor Gordon Brown, whose minister father John used to preach at the St Bryce Kirk church. Mr Brown introduced Dr Greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the \"the world\\'s greatest economist\". Dr Greenspan, 79, who has been in the UK to attend the G7 meeting in London, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to Smith, whose genius he compared to that of Mozart.\\n\\nHe said the philosopher was a \"towering contributor to the modern world\". \"Kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of Adam Smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. \"I am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor\\'s renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area.\" He continued: \"Smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. \"In so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.\"\\n\\nDr Greenspan said Smith\\'s revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. \"The incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the Enlightenment - especially with Smith toiling in the environs of Kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,\" he said. Following his lecture, Dr Greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the Queen at Balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He later opened an exhibition dedicated to Smith in the atrium of Fife College of Further and Higher Education. Joyce Johnston, principal of the college, said: \"It is very fitting that the world\\'s premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world\\'s first economist.\" Dr Greenspan - who became chairman of the Federal Reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in June 2004 - will step down in January next year. He has served under Presidents George W Bush, Bill Clinton, George Bush, and Ronald Reagan. He was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to Gerald Ford.\\n',\n",

And Thanou and Kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. Thanou said: \"I can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse. \"I cannot deny that we made a lot of mistakes during that time. I always said we needed a PR person. \"An athlete would have to be very stupid to take illegal substances when he or she knows that they will undergo tests at any given moment. \"I am a champion.

       " '\\'No-one can define new hunt ban\\'\\n\\nThe new law banning hunting with dogs is \"so poorly drafted\" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt MPs say.\\n\\nThe accusation came after it emerged a Devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to \"chase away unwanted animals\" from his farm. Because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.\\n\\nNorth Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw was put in touch with the Middle Way Group, of which Mr Opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, Defra. He had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the Hunting Act. Mr Bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. The Middle Way group also said Mr Bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. In a later conversation Mr Bradshaw was told that according to Defra\\'s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was \"not in fact hunting as described in the Hunting Act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence\".\\n\\nMr Opik said: \"Hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the Hunting Act. \"Now Defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - \\'chasing away\\' which isn\\'t even covered by the Act. \"However, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. \"How is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?\" Tory MP Peter Luff, another co-chairman of Middle Way, said that the legislation was \"so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence\".\\n\\n\"It is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. However, I seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating.\" Mike Hobday, of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"There is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense. \"If Mr Bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence. \"If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Palestinian economy in decline\\n\\nDespite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report.\\n\\nUnemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. Young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Last year\\'s growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.\\n\\n\"Closures are a key factor behind today\\'s economic crisis in the West Bank,\" said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. The report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. It also called on the Palestinian Authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. This week Colin Powell, US Secretary of State was visiting the West Bank to stress US support for a smooth Palestinian election in January.\\n',\n",
       " 'Text messages aid disaster recovery\\n\\nText messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.\\n\\nThe messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency. Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television. The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi. He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast. Cell phone signals were weak. Land lines were unreliable. So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages. The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \"who needs what and where\". Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayake\\'s text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders. Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use. \"SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,\" he says.\\n\\n\"In every rural community, there\\'s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages.\" Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi\\'s messages. Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Mr Rampersad said: \"Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. \"He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.\" He added: \"Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.\"\\n\\nMr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September. Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.\\n\\nIn only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain. The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. \"This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,\" says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. \"You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you\\'re just one click or one e-mail away,\" he said, \"That\\'s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they\\'re not right on top of the tragedy.\" It is still very early days for the project, though. In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it \"an early proof of concept.\" Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. But there\\'s still another challenge. You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. \"It\\'s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we\\'re trying to do and everything like that,\" says Mr Rampersad. \"So the big problem right now is the same problem we\\'re trying to solve - human communication.\" He is optimistic, however. He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating.\\n\\nClark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production.\\n',\n",

The Belgian had an operation on her left wrist early in the season but injured it again on her return to the tour. Meanwhile, Jelena Dokic, who used to compete for Australia, has opted out of the first Grand Slam of the season. Dokic has not played in the Australian Open since 2001 when she lost in the first round.

       " 'Straw attacked on China arms\\n\\nMoves to lift the European Union\\'s ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives.\\n\\nThe 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of China\\'s crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban. But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns.\\n\\nIn December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections.\\n\\nHe expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: \"This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. \"There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for.\"\\n\\nMr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World At One. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. \"The code of conduct is much more effective, it\\'s a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,\" he said.\\n\\nMr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be \"profoundly wrong\". The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban.\\n\\nMr Ancram argued: \"What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... \"It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong.\" Mr Straw\\'s China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers. He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China\\'s part in the talks on North Korea.\\n',\n",
       " 'China \\'to overtake US net use\\'\\n\\nThe Chinese net-using population looks set to exceed that of the US in less than three years, says a report.\\n\\nChina\\'s net users number 100m but this represents less than 8% of the country\\'s 1.3 billion people. Market analysts Panlogic predicts that net users in China will exceed the 137 million US users of the net by 2008. The report says that the country\\'s culture will mean that Chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.\\n\\nAlready net use in China has a very different character than in many Western nations, said William Makower, chief executive of Panlogic. In many Western nations desktop computers that can access the net are hard to escape at work. By contrast in China workplace machines are relatively rare. This, combined with the relatively high cost of PCs in China and the time it takes to get phone lines installed, helps to explains the huge number of net cafes in China. Only 36% of Chinese homes have telephones according to reports. \"Net usage tends to happen in the evening,\" said Mr Makower, \"they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf&#233;.\" \"Its fundamentally different usage to what we have here,\" he said.\\n\\nNet use in China was still very much an urban phenomenon with most users living on the country\\'s eastern seaboard or in its three biggest cities. The net is key to helping Chinese people keep in touch with friends, said Mr Makower. Many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes. What people can do on the net is also limited by aspects of Chinese life. For instance, said Mr Makower, credit cards are rare in China partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt. \"The most popular way to pay is Cash-On-Delivery,\" he said, \"and that\\'s quite a brake to the development of e-commerce.\" The arrival of foreign banks in China, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said Mr Makower. But if Chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on Western ways of living. \"A large part of the attraction of the internet is that it goes below the radar,\" he said. \"Generally it\\'s more difficult for the government to be able to control it.\" \"Its real value is as an open window onto what\\'s happening elsewhere in the world,\" he said. Government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages Chinese people would not see anywhere else. Familiarity with the net also has a certain social cachet. \"It\\'s a sign of them having made it that they can use the internet and navigate around it,\" said Mr Makower.\\n',\n",

The average house price in England and Wales was Â£182,920, down from Â£187,971 in July-September. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. Land Registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies, since they record completions not mortgage approvals. However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.\\n\\nThe cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.\\n\\nThe biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. House prices rose the slowest in Greater London, being up by 6%. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. There was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital, with 436 properties over Â£1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. Although the figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.

But the Tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is \"outdated and unjust\".\\n\\n\"It sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities,\" he will argue. Mr Howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the UK. \"People from ethnic communities, for example, still earn less than their white counterparts,\" he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was \"free enterprise, free trade, free speech\". The Tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that Hindus and Sikhs as well as Muslims got \"caught in the downdraft of Islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11\".\\n\\nMr Howard will make his speech during a visit to support Tory Parliamentary hopefuls Robert Light and Sayeeda Warsi - \"the first British Muslim woman\" selected to run for MP as a Conservative candidate. He will attack Labour\\'s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out Tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by MPs.

The bank had been accused of illegally concealing Gen Pinochet\\'s assets. More than 3,000 people were killed for political reasons under Gen Pinochet\\'s regime, an official report says. Last month in a US court, Riggs Bank pleaded guilty to failing to report suspicious activity relating to accounts held by Gen Pinochet and the government of Equatorial Guinea. On that occasion, it was ordered to pay a fine of $16m. Gen Pinochet himself has never been put on trial for human rights violations under his 1973-90 rule, despite several high-profile cases against him. He is now facing charges relating to the murder of one Chilean and the disappearance of nine others. He is also being investigated for tax evasion, tax fraud and embezzlement of state funds.\\n\\nThe general\\'s opponents rejoiced at the settlement, which was agreed in a court in the Spanish capital, Madrid. A lawyer for the victims, Eduardo Contreras, told Reuters news agency: \"This demonstrates that the horrors of the Pinochet dictatorship are not a mystery to anyone and that the whole world knows his victims deserve reparations.\" Riggs spokesman Mark Hendrix said the settlement, details of which will be announced next week, was an opportunity to move on. \"This enables the institution to put the matter behind us,\" he told Reuters. The settlement follows a legal complaint filed against the bank by Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon alleging that it had illegally concealed assets.

The original version - which was the Christmas number one in 1984 - sold 750,000 copies in its first week and 3.5 million in total. It was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. However, Band Aid 20 is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It's Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York.\\n\\nBritish stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay's Chris Martin, are well known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono. Record company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20's official website.

       " 'Terror detainees win Lords appeal\\n\\nDetaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK\\'s highest court has ruled.\\n\\nIn a blow to the government\\'s anti-terror measures, the House of Lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. Most of the men are being indefinitely held in Belmarsh prison, south London. The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws. The men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. The ruling creates a major problem for Charles Clarke on his first day as home secretary following David Blunkett\\'s resignation. The Liberal Democrats say Mr Clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor, David Blunkett. Belmarsh prison has been dubbed Britain\\'s Guantanamo Bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws.\\n\\nThe detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office\\'s powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. However those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland.\\n\\nOn Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\". Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. \"It deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford.\"\\n\\nHe said the weakness for the government\\'s case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for British suspects. Lord Hoffmann said: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.\" But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.\\n\\nIn a statement, detainee \\'A\\' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal \\'law\\' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Ben Emmerson QC, representing seven of the detainees, said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. He said they had been given no idea when, if ever, they would be released, had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. When the men were first held, they took their cases to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The commission ruled on 30 July, 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as British people could not be held in the same way. But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.\\n',\n",

Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production.

       " 'Casual gaming to \\'take off\\'\\n\\nGames aimed at \"casual players\" are set to be even bigger in 2005, according to industry experts.\\n\\nEasy-to-play titles that do not require too much time and that are playable online or downloadable to mobile devices will see real growth in the coming year. The trend shows that gaming is not just about big-hitting, games console titles, which appeal more to \"hardcore\" gamers, said a panel of experts. They were speaking before the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas which showcases the latest trends in gadgets and technologies for 2005. The panel also insisted that casual gamers were not just women, a common misconception which pervades current thinking about gamer demographics.\\n\\nCasual games like poker, pool, bridge, bingo and puzzle-based titles, which can be played online or downloaded onto mobile devices, were \"gender neutral\" and different genres attracted different players.\\n\\nGreg Mills, program director at AOL, said its figures suggested that sports-based games attracted 90% of 18 to 24-year-old males, while puzzle games were played by 80% of females. Games like bridge tended to attract the over-50 demographic of gamers.\\n\\nBut hardcore gamers who are more attracted to blockbuster gamers which usually require hi-spec PCs, like Half-Life 2, or Halo 2 on Xbox, also liked to have a different type of gaming experience. \"When hardcore gamers are not playing Halo, they are playing poker and pool, based on our research,\" said Geoff Graber, director of Yahoo Games, which attracts about 12 million gamers a month.\\n\\nWith the growth of powerful PC technology and ownership, broadband take-up, portable players and mobile devices, as well as interactive TV, casual gaming is shaping up to be big business in 2005, according to the panel. The focus for the coming year should be about attracting third-party developers into the field to offer more innovative and multiplayer titles, they agreed. \"We are at a time where we are on the verge of something much bigger,\" said Mr Graber. \"Casual games will get into their stride in 2005, will be really big in 2006 and will be about community.\" With more people finding more to do with their gadgets and high-speed connections, casual games would start to open up the world of gaming as a form of mass-market entertainment to more people. Key to these types of titles is the chance they give people who may not see themselves as gamers to dip in and out of games when they liked.\\n\\nPortal sites which offer casual games, like AOL, Yahoo, and RealArcade, as well as other games-on-demand services, allow people to build up buddy lists so they can return and play against the same people. This aspect of \"community\" is crucial for gamers who just want to have quick access to free or cheap games without committing long periods of time immersed in Â£30 to Â£40 console or PC titles, said the panel. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the CES trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and which officially runs from 6 to 9 January. The main theme is how new devices are getting better at talking to each other, allowing people to enjoy digital content, like audio, video and images, when they want, and where they want.\\n',\n",

       " 'Blind student \\'hears in colour\\'\\n\\nA blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.\\n\\nVictor Wong, a graduate student from Hong Kong studying at Cornell University in New York State, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. To study \"space weather\" Mr Wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. A number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in Braille. Mr Wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.\\n\\n\"The images have three dimensions and I had to find a way of reading them myself,\" Mr Wong told the BBC News website. \"For the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - I felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.\" He tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. In order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. The software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. Mr Wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. \"If I took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn\\'t work that well.\"\\n\\nMr Wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a \"colour memory\" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. \"As the notes increase in pitch I know the colour\\'s getting redder and redder, and in my mind\\'s eye a patch of red appears.\" The colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and Mr Wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. But he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.\\n',\n",

There will also be elections for local councils and mayors in parts of England on 5 May. The deadline for voters to register in Northern Ireland expired on Thursday.\\n\\nCompleted registration forms can be handed into local authorities throughout the day on Friday, and some will accept them by fax. As well as for English county councils, polls for unitary authorities at Bristol, Isle of Wight and Stockton-on-Tees and mayors at Doncaster, Hartlepool, North Tyneside and Stoke-on-Trent are also scheduled for 5 May. Last week Preston City Council reported that more than 14,000 of its voters were not registered. Its electoral roll fell by 17.5% in a year - the biggest dip in the UK. An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: \"Political decisions are made on your behalf every day but only by using your right to vote at an election can you really have a say on the issues you care about. \"If you want your voice to be heard on 5 May you will need to have registered by Friday 11 March.\" Council tax payers are not eligible to vote without registration, officials have stressed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Thousands join strike in Wales\\n\\nThousands of civil servants were on strike across Wales on Friday in protest at planned job cuts.\\n\\nA range of services in Wales were affected as civil servants in Wales joined the UK-wide strike. The strike, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union, was the biggest by civil servants in a decade. The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown\\'s announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales. The worst-affected area in Wales will be the Department of Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened. Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham. Gordon Brown issued a defiant statement about the strike, saying the action would not affect the government\\'s \"determination\" to make savings in order to increase investment in healthcare, education, transport and the fight against crime. \"Our decisions mean more police, more teachers, more doctors and more nurses,\" he said. \"We will provide help with information, relocation and retraining to help staff move into frontline work within the public sector, but we will not be diverted from these necessary changes so that we can make this essential investment.\" The UK-wide action hit Jobcentres, benefit agencies, pensions offices and driving test centres. The strike also affected the Welsh assembly building in Cardiff Bay, where only pass-holders were allowed in.\\n\\nPickets were in place across Wales, with protests around the country. PCS Union spokesman Jeff Evans said: \"In Wales the civil service is major employer, there are more civil servants employed in Wales proportionately than in any other part of the country. \"Our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country. \"Parts of Objective One areas and Welsh-speaking areas will be particularly affected by these cuts.\" The chancellor has said that the cuts will allow funding for more teachers and police. Piers Freelove is senior benefit officer on the picket line at Companies House, in Cardiff. He said: \"The majority of people have decided not to come in because of the threat to their jobs. \"I joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension, as we thought, and pay, and it\\'s those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs. \"People like pensioners need a face-to-face service not an impersonal service on the phone which is what they want to impose.\" PCSU deputy general secretary Hugh Lanning, who was on the same picket line, said: \"We\\'re asking for them to negotiate not just to make announcements. \"There\\'s a sensible way to do things and at the moment they\\'re not even talking about how to go about it sensibly.\" \"The ballot was for one day\\'s action. No further action is anticipated without a further ballot of staff.\" The Welsh Assembly Government said: \"This is a strike about national civil service issues. It is not about specific issues local to Wales or the assembly.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ask Jeeves joins web log market\\n\\nAsk Jeeves has bought the Bloglines website to improve the way it handles content from web journals or blogs.\\n\\nThe Bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in. Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web. How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.\\n\\nBloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually. To do this it makes use of a technology known as Really Simple Syndication (RSS) that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals. The acquisition follows similar moves by other search sites. Google acquired Pyra Labs, makers of the Blogger software, in 2003. In 2004 MSN introduced its own blog system and Yahoo has tweaked its technology to do a better job of handling blog entries. Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world. He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.\\n\\n\"The universe of readers is vastly larger than the universe of writers,\" he said. Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask\\'s My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links. \"Search engines are about discovering information for the first time and RSS is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites,\" he said. It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates. There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone. \"Our intent is to take our time to figure out the right business model not to try to monetise it right away,\" he said. Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology. \"Being able to search the blogosphere as one corpus of information will be very useful in its own right,\" said Mr Lanzone. Rumours about the acquisition were broken by the Napsterization weblog which said it got the hint from Ask Jeeves insiders.\\n',\n",

And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: \"The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. \"Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. \"It\\'s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.\" Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: \"Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn\\'t let us down. \"He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. \"He had been waiting years to be in this position.\" Spain\\'s victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.\\n\\nAged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. \"What a great way to finish the year,\" said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. \"I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.\" \"Obviously it\\'s unrealistic to say that we\\'re going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. \"But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,\" said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville\\'s Olympic Stadium. \"It\\'s just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,\" said the American. \"I had my chances and just didn\\'t convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. \"They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It\\'s as simple as that.\"\\n',\n",

The US said it filed the complaint after talks failed to find a solution.\\n\\nThe move came in the same week that the US and EU stepped back from confrontation in a tense dispute over aircraft subsidies to European manufacturer Airbus and US firm Boeing. New EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said on Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to reopen talks in the aircraft subsidies row, which led to tit-for-tat WTO filings in last autumn.\\n\\nExplaining why it has asked the WTO to set up a dispute settlement panel on customs barriers, the US Trade Representative\\'s Office said that it wants to tackle the issue \"early in the EU\\'s process of dealing with the problems of enlargement\". Ten countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, joined the EU in May. The US said its trade with the 25 EU member countries was worth $155.2bn (Â£82.8bn) in 2003. \"Although the EU is a customs union, there is no single EU customs administration,\" a statement issued on behalf of Robert Zoellick, US Trade Representative, said. Lack of uniformity, coupled with lack of procedures for prompt EU-wide review can hinder US exports, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\", An EU spokesman in Washington dismissed the US complaint. \"We think the US case is very weak.

His indictment includes charges of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports with regulators. If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence.

Yet as competition intensified and the telecoms boom petered out, WorldCom found itself under growing financial stress. When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud. It will coincide with the retrial of former Tyco International chief Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant, accused of looting the industrial conglomerate to the tune of $600m.

Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.\\n\\nFor anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony\\'s Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.\\n\\nBut he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. \"He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him,\" said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple.

The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a \"self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device\".\\n\\n\"In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,\" said the magazine.\\n\\n\"In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,\" it concluded.

Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position).

       " 'Royal couple watch nation\\'s mood\\n\\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation\\'s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.\\n\\nMrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle. A Daily Telegraph poll of 1,313 people suggests two-thirds of Britons support the couple\\'s decision to marry. But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king. Some 47% believe she should have no title, while 7% think she should become queen.\\n\\nThe poll also found that the majority of Britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation, with the Queen handing the throne to her grandson Prince William, 22, on her death or abdication. On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: \"I\\'m just coming down to earth.\" She displayed her diamond engagement ring - a Royal Family heirloom - to reporters. Charles said he and his wife-to-be were \"absolutely delighted\". Their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.\\n\\nThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh said the news had made them \"very happy\". Princes William and Harry said they are \"very happy\" and wish the couple \"all the luck in the future\". The wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in St George\\'s Chapel at which the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will preside.\\n\\nThe marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. If he became king, Charles would be the supreme governor of the Church of England and some Anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees. \"His divorce from Diana and the disappointment the country felt over how Diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [Prince Charles],\" said Ros Coward, who wrote the authorised biography of Diana, princess of Wales. The Archbishop of Canterbury said: \"I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step.\" Tony Blair said he was \"delighted\" for the couple and offered his congratulations, as did Conservative leader Michael Howard and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Australia\\'s Prime Minister John Howard also offered his congratulations, adding that their decision to marry was a \"sensible and a good thing\". Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince\\'s Trust. Clarence House staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.\\n',\n",
       " 'Rings of steel combat net attacks\\n\\nGambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.\\n\\nMany extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. But now deep defences are being put in place by some of the UK\\'s biggest net firms to stop these attacks. Increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. \"Net firms are realising that it\\'s not just about anti-virus and firewalls,\" said Paul King, chief security architect at Cisco. \"There are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres.\" Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King. This overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.\\n\\nMalcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. \"It does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,\" he said.\\n\\nSo far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave. However, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. The defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. \"It\\'s about understanding what\\'s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,\" she said. \"We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that\\'s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,\" said Ms Capella. This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.\\n\\nTypically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. Hijacked computers are known as zombies or \\'bots and collections of them are called \\'bot nets. Many spammers rent out \\'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.\\n\\nMost of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking PCs shut off can be difficult. Often Pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. \"The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,\" said Ms Capella. \"We ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning.\" Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. Energis took a similar approach, said Mr Seagrave. \"We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,\" said Mr Seagrave. Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. Information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. He said Energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target. \"We have people in places where they shouldn\\'t be, monitoring tech sites,\" he said. Sometimes though, he said, spotting the next victim was easy. \"You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,\" said Mr Seagrave.\\n',\n",
       " 'Voters flock to blog awards site\\n\\nVoting is under way for the annual Bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year.\\n\\nNominations were announced on Sunday, but traffic to the official site was so heavy that the website was temporarily closed because of too many visitors. Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog. Blogs had a huge year, with a top US dictionary naming \"blog\" word of 2004. Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to US research think-tank Pew Internet and American Life, but less than 40% of the total are updated at least once every two months.\\n\\nNikolai Nolan, who has run the Bloggies for the past five years, told the BBC News website he was not too surprised by the amount of voters who crowded the site. \"The awards always get a lot of traffic; this was just my first year on a server with a bandwidth limit, so I had to guess how much I\\'d need,\" he said. There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before. Several entries reflected specific news events. \"There are four nominations for the South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog, which is a pretty timely one for 2005,\" said Mr Nolan.\\n\\nThe big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year. The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest. Fighting it out for the coveted award are Gawker, This Fish Needs a Bicycle, Wonkette, Boing Boing, and Gothamist. In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs, The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category. GreenFairyDotcom, Londonist, Hicksdesign, PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog.\\n\\nIncluded in the other categories is best \"meme\". This is for the top \"replicating idea that spread about weblogs\". Nominations include Flickr, a web photo album which lets people upload, tag, share and publish their images to blogs. Podcasting has also made an appearance in the category. It is an increasingly popular idea that makes use of RSS (really simple syndication) and audio technology to let people easily make their own radio shows, and distribute them automatically onto portable devices.\\n\\nMany are done by those who already have text-based blogs, so they are almost like audio blogs. Three new categories have been added to the list this year, including best food, best entertainment, and best writing of a weblog. One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog. The winners of the fifth annual Bloggies are chosen by the public. Public voting closes on 3 February and the winners will be announced sometime between 13 and 15 March.\\n',\n",

       " 'Paraguay novel wins US book prize\\n\\nA novel set in 19th century Paraguay has won the $10,000 (Â£5,390) fiction prize at the US National Book Awards.\\n\\nLily Tuck\\'s The News From Paraguay is a fictionalised tale about Paraguayan leader Francisco Solano Lopez and his Irish mistress. But the annual awards, which were presented in New York on Wednesday, were not without controversy. Children\\'s author Judy Blume, who was given an honourary medal, used the ceremony to speak out over censorship.\\n\\nSales of Blume\\'s books have exceeded 75 million, but her work - which features frank narratives about families, religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors. Blume said: \"The urge to ban is contagious. It spreads like wildfire from community to community. Please speak out. Censors hate publicity.\" Her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness. Last year\\'s honorary winner, Stephen King, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.\\n\\nThis year\\'s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth\\'s The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women. One fiction judge, Stewart O\\'Nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said: \"I would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy.\" The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle\\'s for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family\\'s fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. The award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 Commission Report looking into the events of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US. Pete Hautman won the young people\\'s literature prize for his novel Godless. The winner in the poetry category was Jean Valentine for Door in the Mountain: New and Collected Poems, 1965-2003.\\n',\n",
       " 'Market unfazed by Aurora setback\\n\\nAs the Aurora limped back to its dock on 20 January, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.\\n\\nThe ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year\\'s profits and a potential PR fiasco. No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. The warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world\\'s biggest investment banks had upped its target for Carnival\\'s share price, from Â£35 to Â£36.20. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT Carnival\\'s shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at Â£32.26.\\n\\nWhy the mismatch between the public perception and the market\\'s response? \"The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says Deutsche Bank\\'s Simon Champion. \"It was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. But the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"\\n\\nDespite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, Aurora is just one vessel in a large Carnival fleet, the UK\\'s P&O Princess group having been merged into the much larger US firm in 2003. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"Carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" Mr Champion.\\n\\nSimilarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. The hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the Aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. \"While not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from Citigroup Smith Barney in a note to clients on Friday. \"Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" After all, the Aurora incident may be big news in the UK - but for Carnival customers elsewhere it\\'s unlikely to make too much of a splash.\\n\\nAssuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival\\'s favour. In the wake of P&O Princess\\'s takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. Given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said David Anders at Merrill Lynch on Thursday. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.\\n',\n",
       " 'US interest rate rise expected\\n\\nUS interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since June following the US Federal Reserve\\'s latest rate-setting meeting later on Tuesday.\\n\\nBorrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25%. The move comes as a recovery in the US economy, the world\\'s biggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. The dollar\\'s record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. \"We are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,\" said Ken Kim, an analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research. \"It\\'s not a risk, it\\'s actually happening.\" Mr Kim added that borrowing costs could rise further.\\n\\nThe Fed has said that it will move in a \"measured\" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish US and global growth.\\n\\nWith the economic picture now looking more rosy, the Fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in June, August, September and November. Although the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to September, analysts warn that Fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery\\'s sails. Earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer confidence is subdued. \"I think the Fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility,\" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. \"While inflation has moved up, it hasn\\'t moved up a lot.\" \"If economic growth should subside... the Fed would feel it has the flexibility to pause in its tightening. \"But if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly, I think the Fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"A year to remember for Irish\\n\\nThere used to be one subliminal moment during a year in Irish rugby that stood out more than most.\\n\\nWell, at least there used to one. Now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. It has been quite a year for the Irish, and not just with Eddie O'Sullivan's Triple Crown winning international outfit either. Right down through the ranks Irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. But most of the kudos will go to O'Sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first Triple Crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. For the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the RBS Six Nations. But in the three games in November which included a victory over Tri-Nations champions and Grand Slam chasing South Africa, Ireland finsihed the year on a high. The 18-12 victory at Lansdowne Road was only their second victory over the Boks after the initial success back in 1965. That success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in Blomefontein and Cape Town in the summer. Those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against France, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. But the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of World Cup champions England on their precious Twickenham turf. The winning try was conceived in O'Sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by Girvan Dempsey. For me, the try of the Championship. O'Sullivan's career is now in vertical take-off mode. It is no wonder that Sir Clive Woodward has elevated the Galway-based coach to head the Lions Test side. Not only that, but a fair majority of the present Ireland side will be wearing red next June in New Zealand.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. In Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell, Ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. Gordon D'Arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. But it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to Ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. The under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the World Cup final in Scotland only to be beaten by a powerful All Black side in the decider. The young Irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to England in the Six Nations under-21 tournament. On the provincial front, Leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the Heineken Cup looked a good wager. While Ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was Munster again flying the flag for the Irish. Looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners Wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at Lansdowne Road. How Wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat Toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. Ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural Celtic Cup in winning the Celtic League when they were pipped at the post by the Scarlets in the final game.\\n\\nUlster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach Mark McCall. The once famous Ravenhill fortress was breached four times as Ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the Celtic League. Leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under Declan Kidney is another thing. On the down side, Irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. Teenage star John McCall died while playing for the Ireland against New Zealand in the under-19 World Cup game in Durban. That happened only 10 days after he led Royal Armagh to their first Ulster Schools' Cup success since 1977. The death of former Ireland coach and Lions flanker Mike Doyle in a car crash in Northern Ireland shocked the rugby fraternity A larger than life character, Doyle had coached Ireland to the Triple Crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. Ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known Londonderry YM player Jim Huey, Coleraine's Jonathan Hutchinson, and Belfast Harlequins lock Johnny Poole. They all passed away long before the full-time whistle.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The \\'ticking budget\\' facing the US\\n\\nThe budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government\\'s ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.\\n\\nThe trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation\\'s total annual output.\\n\\nThis upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock.\\n\\nInterest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen?\\n\\nBy definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn\\'t adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration\\'s chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans\\' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It\\'s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation\\'s elderly and indigent.\\n\\nOn the revenue side, the lion\\'s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.\\n\\nSome rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.\\n',\n",
       " 'Rich pickings for hi-tech thieves\\n\\nViruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.\\n\\nThe shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home PCs. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. Instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.\\n\\nThe growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. Before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. But many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.\\n\\n\"You cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,\" said Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm Clearswift. Now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. \"It\\'s about outright criminality now,\" said Mr Simpson, explaining why this change has come about. He said many of the criminal programs came from Eastern Europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. Former virus writer Marek Strihavka, aka Benny from the 29A virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. No longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. Not least, said Paul King, principal security consultant at Cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. \"In many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,\" he said. Few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. \"If you think of criminals they do not do clever,\" said Mr King, \"they just do what works.\"\\n\\nAs the tactics used by malicious programs change, said Mr King, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. Now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.\\n\\nMany will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. As well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. \"The main motivation now is money,\" said Gary Stowell, spokesman for St Bernard software. Mr Stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. With almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. So-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. In some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on PCs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.\\n',\n",
       " 'Camera phones are \\'must-haves\\'\\n\\nFour times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in Europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts Gartner.\\n\\nGlobally, the number sold will reach 159 million, an increase of 104%. The report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built-in camera by 2008. Improving imaging technology in mobiles is making them an increasingly \"must-have\" buy. In Europe, cameras on mobiles can take 1.3 megapixel images. But in Japan and Asia Pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images. Japan still dominates mobile phone technology, and the uptake there is huge. By 2008, according to Gartner, 95% of all mobiles sold there will have cameras on them.\\n\\nCamera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Services). This has changed in the last 18 months. Handset makers have concentrated on trying to make phones easier to use. Realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.\\n\\nMobile companies have introduced more ways for people to share photos with other people. These have included giving people easier ways to publish them on websites, or mobile blogs - moblogs. But the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks. Image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving. The Gartner report suggests that by mid-2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels. Consumer digital cameras images range from two to four megapixels in quality, and up to six megapixels on a high-end camera. But a lot of work is being done to make camera phones more like digital cameras. Some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly-lit conditions, like nightclubs. Other developments include wide-angle modes, basic editing features, and better sensors and processors for recording film clips.\\n\\nImages from camera phones have even made it into the art world. An exhibition next month in aid of the charity Mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.\\n\\nThe exhibition, Fonetography, will feature images taken by photographers David Bailey, Rankin and Nan Goldin, and artists Sir Peter Blake, Tracey Emin and Jack Vettriano. But some uses for them have worried many organisations. Intel, Samsung, the UK\\'s Foreign Office and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in the US, have decided to ban camera phones from their buildings for fear of sensitive information being snapped and leaked. Many schools, fitness centres and local councils have also banned them over fears about privacy and misuse. Italy\\'s information commissioner has also voiced concern and has issued guidelines on where and how the phones can be used. But camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers\\' profits. According to recent figures, Sony Ericsson\\'s profits tripled in the third-quarter because of new camera phones.

The two companies held four days of talks after Foster\\'s bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January. A merger would create a global player with worldwide annual sales of 39m cases and revenues of A$2.6bn.\\n\\nSouthcorp said Foster\\'s A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a \"excellent strategic fit\" but undervalued the company. \"Southcorp\\'s board has informed Foster\\'s that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company,\" said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn.\\n\\nSouthcorp said Foster\\'s takeover offer was \"opportunistic\". However, it said that the offer may represent an \\'opening bid\\', opening up the possibility of Foster\\'s returning with an improved offer.\\n\\nFoster\\'s said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an \"unrivalled\" collection of premium wine brands. Despite being best known for brewing Foster\\'s Lager, Foster\\'s is already one of Australia\\'s largest wine producers, owning the Beringer and Wolf Blass brands among others. \"The combination of Foster\\'s and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia\\'s competitive position on the global stage,\" said Trevor O\\'Hoy, Foster\\'s chief executive officer. Foster\\'s spent A$584m on buying an 18.8% stake in Southcorp from the Oatley family, which founded the Rosemount Estates business and later merged it into Southcorp. Shares in both companies were suspended while the two held talks about a deal. Southcorp\\'s shares rose 12% to A$4.76 on news of the offer but Foster\\'s shares fell 3.7% to A$5.44.\\n',\n",

       " 'China continues breakneck growth\\n\\nChina\\'s economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003\\'s 9.1%.\\n\\nThe news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.\\n\\nStill, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.\\n\\nDespite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.\\n\\nChina\\'s economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, China\\'s currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. \"Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'China suspends 26 power projects\\n\\nChina has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.\\n\\nThe move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. \"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency\\'s website.\\n\\nSome of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government\\'s battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or \\'river of golden sand\\' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency\\'s list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.\\n\\nThe Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China\\'s energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.\\n',\n",
       " 'UK \\'discriminated against Roma\\'\\n\\nThe government\\'s immigration rules racially discriminated against Roma (Gypsies) seeking entry into the UK, the Law Lords have ruled.\\n\\nIt follows a Home Office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly Roma, from boarding flights to Britain from the Czech capital, Prague. Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed \"racism at the heart of the government\\'s asylum policy\". The Home Office said it had not meant to discriminate against anyone. It said it would look at the implications of the ruling, but pointed out the controls were no longer in place because Czechs are now entitled to free movement across Europe.\\n\\nThe screening took place at the airport in July 2001, at a time of concern about the number of asylum seekers entering Britain.\\n\\nThose refused \"pre-clearance\" were effectively prevented from travelling to the UK, because no airline would carry them. Lady Hale, sitting with Lords Bingham, Steyn, Hope and Carswell, said many Roma had good reason to want to leave the Czech Republic because of persecution. But she said they were treated more sceptically than non-Roma passengers by immigration officers \"acting on racial grounds\". Lady Hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.\\n\\nLiberty said statistics suggested Roma Czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by British immigration officials at Prague airport than non-Roma Czechs. It took up the case of six unnamed Roma Czechs refused entry to Britain, and that of the European Roma Rights Centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised Roma people. It lost a High Court action in October 2002 when a judge said the system was \"no more or less objectionable\" than a visa control system. He ruled there was no obligation on Britain not to take steps to prevent a potential refugee from approaching its border to claim asylum.\\n\\nThe Court of Appeal then decided the practice almost inevitably discriminated against Roma, but that this was justified because they were more likely to seek asylum. Immigration law allows officials to discriminate against citizens from named countries, but it does not allow officers to go further than that.\\n\\nResponding to the ruling, a Home Office spokesman said: \"The scheme was operated two years ago as a short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from Prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the UK.\"\\n\\nWelcoming the ruling, Maeve Sherlock, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"Human rights abuses against the Roma in Eastern Europe are well documented, and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.\" Amnesty International\\'s Jan Shaw said: \"That the government\\'s own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the Czech Republic.\" But the chairman of Migration Watch UK, Sir Andrew Green, said the House of Lords decision was a \"step in the wrong direction\". \"The basic point is that the government has a duty to control our borders and this decision appears to extend the race relations legislation beyond sensible limits.\"\\n',\n",

And in possession, we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward.\" Before the match, McClaren had said that a win over the Italian giants would put Boro firmly on the European footballing map. And after they did just that he said: \"It was a perfect European night. For the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake. \"There have been many good performances but this was something special.\\n\\n\"You can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing. To win in Europe you need to defend well, and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games. \"We can also score goals, and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had, so we have good balance. McClaren\\'s only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals. \"It should have been more convincing,\" said McClaren. \"But I had watched Lazio in recent weeks and I saw them score a late equaliser against Inter Milan on Saturday so I knew we needed a second goal.\\n\\n\"No matter what anybody says, Lazio are favourites to win this competition.\" Middlesbrough forward Boudewijn Zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals. \"We didn\\'t expect it to be that one-sided,\" said Zenden. \"We did quite well in the first half, we pressured them and they didn\\'t cope with that. \"I think we played quite well and it was a very good game, especially in the first half.\" The Holland international said Boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games. \"We\\'ve got a very good feeling, there is a good spirit, all the lads work hard for each other and it\\'s a squad of friendly players, which I think you can see on the pitch,\" he added.\\n',\n",

The psychological drama stars Stellan Skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film. Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004. The prequel project was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director. However Frankenheimer pulled out in 2002, a month before he died.\\n\\nSkarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. Principal footage was shot in Morocco and Rome at a reported cost of $32m. However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough. As well as replacing Schrader with Harlin - the director behind Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger - the producers also changed most of the cast, but Swedish star Skarsgard stayed in the Merrin role. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (Â£40.7m) worldwide. The festival screening will be the first time that Schrader's film has been seen in public. Reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on DVD have yet to be confirmed. Other films at the festival in the Belgium capital, which runs from 11-26 March, include the US horror hit Boogeyman and the forthcoming sequel Ring 2, as well as a selection of films adapted from the works of Jules Verne.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004\\n\\nExports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.\\n\\nThe spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. It may also increase pressure on China to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. State Administration of Taxation head Xie Xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; Â£165bn).\\n\\nAccording to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. With imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. The increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to Mr Xie. China's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the United States soar even further and made trade with China a sensitive political issue in Washington. The peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by US lawmakers for job losses at home. A US report issued on Tuesday on behalf of a Congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. The pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Parties\\' plans for council tax\\n\\nAnger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average English bill rose 12.9%.\\n\\nPensioners\\' protests spread - some marched, others simply refused to pay the increase. Some, such as 83-year-old Elizabeth Winkfield, said they would rather go to jail. The Audit Commission found the whole local government finance system was \"fundamentally flawed\" and all three of the main parties have said the system has to change.\\n\\nLabour says it wants to retain the property-based tax but reform it to make it fairer and says there is scope for councils to become more efficient. They say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a Â£100 lump sum for the over-70s and last year the government capped some local councils\\' budgets to keep demands down. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott has said the current system is not sustainable in the long term and said there would be \"radical reform\". The party says this year\\'s increases will be the lowest in a decade. A report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. An independent inquiry into its findings, the Lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005.\\n\\nThe Tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year-on-year increases in council tax. They say they can save Â£4bn on \"government waste\", of which Â£1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners\\' bills by an average of Â£340. It would not be means tested, say the Tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. Instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of Â£500. The Tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes - currently graded according to their value in 1991 - because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band.\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrats want to do away with the council tax altogether and switch to a local income tax of the kind seen in the USA, Norway and Switzerland. The rate would be set locally, but administered by the Inland Revenue which they say would save at least Â£300m. They say the council tax is the most unpopular and most unfair tax in Britain, because it puts a \"ceiling\" on what the richest pay. The party says it would aim for a Â£5,000 tax-free personal allowance, or a Â£7,000 allowance for the over-65s. After that income would be taxed up to Â£100,000. The Lib Dems say their plan is fairer, more efficient, has already been tested abroad and offers more accountability.\\n',\n",

He also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in Northern Ireland. Paying tribute, the Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said Lord Scarman was one of the \"great advocates of our generation\".\\n\\n\"His legacy from his decisions in the Lords and the Court of Appeal is substantial. \"His work in the wake of the Brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.\\n\\n\"A great judge, a great lawyer and a great man.\" Lord Scarman\\'s nephew George Ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on Wednesday, would be \"sadly missed\".\\n\\nThe Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, who is the most senior judge in England and Wales, said it was Lord Scarman\\'s \"pioneering work\" which paved the way for the Human Rights Act 1998. \"He was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,\" he said. \"He was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.\"\\n\\nDame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, the president of the Family Justice Division, said Lord Scarman was a \"good and humane judge\" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. Lord Scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in Brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. During the following three days of disturbances that spread to the Midlands, Merseyside, Bristol and Leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.\\n\\nThe inquiry famously settled on the so-called \"rotten apples\" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. It spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the Police Complaints Authority. Trevor Phillips, chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, praised Lord Scarman\\'s \"ability to listen\". He said: \"When Lord Scarman toured the streets of Brixton his presence was electrifying. \"A community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the English establishment. \"His great quality was the ability to listen to young people of all backgrounds, many of whose language he could barely understand, genuinely to hear what they had to say and to talk to them as human beings. \"He never lost the special combination of wisdom, humanity and the spark of radicalism that marked his watershed report into the Brixton riots.\"\\n',\n",

I said then you don\\'t do deals over jobs like this - you don\\'t.\\n\\n\"What both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.\" The book, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had \"mutual animosity and contempt\" for each other.\\n\\nIt claims Tony Blair felt by November 2003 he had lost voters\\' trust because of the Iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the Labour Party. And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down. According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\" But he then changed his mind in June 2004, following intervention from allies in the Cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.\\n\\nMr Peston told BBC News: \"My understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. \"What the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. \"I think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private I don\\'t think the relationship is good because Brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership.\" But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: \"When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. \"All sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims.\" He admitted to a \"sense of frustration\" about the allegations which he said had been made \"countless times\".\\n\\nThere has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the Asian tsunami. These rumours were fuelled by Mr Blair\\'s decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by Mr Brown on UK plans to tackle global poverty with a new \"Marshall Plan\" for Africa. There was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other\\'s response to the disaster.

Lord Kinnock - who led Labour from 1983 until 1992 - was until recently one of Britain\\'s EU commissioners. A former critic of the House of Lords, he has said he will use the Upper House to advocate its reform and to talk on issues like higher education. \"I accepted the kind invitation to enter the House of Lords as a working peer for practical political reasons,\" he said when his peerage was first announced. \"It is a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression.\" During his induction into the Upper House, Lord Kinnock was accompanied by Lords Leader Baroness Amos and Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, a former aide to the ex-Labour leader.

But he joined the shadow cabinet in 1980, and after Labour\\'s heavy defeat in the 1983 he was elected leader. He took on the far-left Militant Tendency and began the long process of returning his party to the centre ground. He was not expected to win the 1987 election, when Margaret Thatcher was still riding high, but was bitterly disappointed to lose the next one in 1992 to John Major, and stepped down. He remained an MP until 1995, when he resigned to become European commission for transport.

I can\\'t condone what he\\'s done. He was out of order but he knows that,\" said Redknapp. \"He\\'s a decent lad. He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. Off the pitch you couldn\\'t meet a nicer lad.\" Prutton has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal\\'s Robert Pires, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints\\' midfield man.\\n\\nHe said: \"It\\'s an horrendous situation. I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job. \"I\\'ve also seen what happened to Pires\\' leg and I\\'m sorry for that as well.\" \"I apologise for the people who saw it. I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don\\'t pay money to see that sort of thing. \"It\\'s not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur. Sometimes you react and it\\'s beyond your control, \" added Prutton.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mobiles \\'not media players yet\\'\\n\\nMobiles are not yet ready to be all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices which will replace portable media players, say two reports.\\n\\nDespite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter. A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is \"unlikely\" in Europe until 2007. Technical issues and standards must be resolved first, said the report. Batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. Bringing music download services based on the success of computer-based download services will put more demands on battery life.\\n\\nFifty percent of Europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets. \"Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready,\" said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research. \"Mobile music services should be new and different, and enable operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches.\" Other problems facing mobile music include limited storage on phones, compared to portable players which can hold up to 40GB of music. The mobile industry is keen to get into music downloading, after the success of Apple\\'s iTunes, Napster and other net music download services.\\n\\nWith phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch TV on the move. In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones. But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait. Currently, TV-like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several European operators, like Italy\\'s TIM and 3. Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report.\\n\\nVarious standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are making use of terrestrial TV masts to broadcast compressed signals to handsets with extra receivers. A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day. The service uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV. But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe. Operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real-time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers. The cost and infrastructure needs to set up the services will need to be addressed. Handsets also need to be able to work with the DVB-H standard. TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts. People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner. Digital video recorders, like Europe\\'s Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch. As a result, people may see broadcasting straight to mobiles as taking away that control. More powerful smartphones like the XDA II, Nokia 6600, SonyEricsson P900 and the Orange E200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e-mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. A report by analysts InStat/MDR has predicted that smartphone shipments will grow by 44% over the next five years. It says that smartphones will make up 117 million out of 833 million handsets shipped globally by 2009.\\n',\n",
       " 'US actor \\'found with gun residue\\'\\n\\nActor Robert Blake had gunshot residue on his hands and clothes the night his wife was shot dead, a court has heard.\\n\\nBut it may not have come from the shot that killed Bonny Lee Bakley in 2001, Mr Blake\\'s murder trial was told by criminalist Steven Dowell. Mr Dowell told a Los Angeles court the residue may have come from Mr Blake\\'s revolver, his gun collection, his presence at the crime scene or police. The 71-year-old former star of US TV drama Baretta has denied murder. Mr Blake said he found Ms Bakley, 44, dead in a car after they left a restaurant.\\n\\nHe said he briefly returned to the restaurant to collect a gun he had left behind and discovered her body when he returned. The gun he collected was not the murder weapon. It could also have been picked up if he touched or leant on the car when he found the body, or from a police box in which his clothes were later stored. The box had come from an area where officers went after being on the firing range. But Mr Dowell also said the residue would have been present if Mr Blake fired a gun that night. Witnesses have already told the trial Mr Blake \"stood out as being quite nervous and agitated\" at the restaurant before the murder. The actor, who won an Emmy for playing a maverick detective in the 1970s TV cop drama Baretta, could face life in prison if convicted.\\n',\n",
       " 'Blair returns from peace mission\\n\\nPrime Minister Tony Blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the Middle East to try to resurrect the peace process.\\n\\nMr Blair held talks with his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas. He confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the Palestinian Authority and address security issues would come at a London conference in March. Mr Blair also made a surprise trip to Iraq this week. The Israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. Mr Blair briefly visited the tomb of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah - the first world leader to do so. He nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what Palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.\\n\\nThe BBC\\'s Paul Reynolds says the London conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, who is expected to win the Palestinian presidential election on 9 January. At a news conference following talks with Mr Blair, Mr Abbas said the British prime minister was \"in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit\". He added: \"Your endeavour to hold a conference in London is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose.\" In an interview with the BBC\\'s political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be \"tough, but at least we have got the first step\". Mr Blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the Israelis, but said the Israelis were entitled to expect Palestinians to give up terrorism. He argued that Mr Sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from Gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not seen \"the slightest step\" the Palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged Palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city. He was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. He also flew to Basra in southern Iraq where British forces are stationed.\\n',\n",
       " '\\'Podcasters\\' look to net money\\n\\nNasa is doing it, 14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it, couples are doing it, gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it.\\n\\nIt is podcasting - DIY radio in the form of downloadable MP3 audio files. They can done by anyone who has a microphone, simple software, the net, and something to say. Some liken them to talking \"audioblogs\" because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. They are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the \"movement\" is at very early stages. \"It\\'s about real people saying real things and communicating,\" says Adam Curry, former MTV VJ and the Pied Piper of podcasting. He was one of a community of people who created iPodder, a small computer program, known as an \"aggregator\".\\n\\nIt collects and automatically sends MP3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play WMP formats. Those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe - for free - to that show\\'s \"feed\". When a new podcast is available, it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer. \"It is totally going to kill the business model of radio,\" thinks Curry. \"I just did a tour of Madison Avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are,\" he says. \"And they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don\\'t listen to radio. \"They are on MSN, they\\'ve got their iPod, their MP3 player, they\\'ve got their Xbox - they are not listening to radio. \"So how are they going to reach these audiences? \"It is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it.\"\\n\\nIt is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. Ian Fogg, Jupiter Research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like Apple and Microsoft, get involved. \"It is a nascent area but quite exciting. It is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over,\" he says.\\n\\n\"Podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. It is another aspect of the \"time-shifting\" of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want, when, and wherever you want. Audiences are in the 10s, 100s, and 1,000s rather than millions. More than 4,300 podcasts are currently listed. Curry\\'s Daily Source Code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners.\\n\\nBut Dave Winer is doubtful. He designed the format called RSS (Really Simple Syndication), which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. Podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. He is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net, Scripting News. He thinks its power lies in its democratising potential, not in its \"over-hyped\" business promise.\\n\\n\"We\\'re the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we\\'re doing. \"No matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn\\'t going to make very much money,\" he says. \"Podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with \\'audiences\\' measured in the single digits, like e-mail or blogs. \"Maybe in a few years, maybe six or seven digits. But it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon.\" Curry and associate Ron Bloom\\'s new venture, called PodShow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts. Because of the way podcasts work, based on RSS, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. \"When you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. The audience is pre-selected. They have decided to subscribe to your program,\" explains Curry. Advertising, in his eyes, can be tailored to podcasts, to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive. \"How I believe this will work, is to create a network that, in aggregation, will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters. \"I have 50, 60, 70,000 listeners. I could make a couple of bucks off that, but not much. If you are talking a million podcasters, and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves, then that is kind of interesting.\" Essentially, he says, if you are doing a bass fishing podcast, someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. He is clear the ads will not be the traditional \"in-your-face\" type familiar to commercial radio now. \"We are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place.\"\\n\\nIt is happening already. Coffee-loving Curry has sold $4,000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to Amazon from his site.\\n\\nOthers use in-show promotions, like The Dawn and Drew Show. One, Eric Rice, has won sponsorship from Warner Bros. He can now legally play the music of a band Warner Bros wants to push. Some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. Others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. One thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. The creative forces behind radio are elated, says Curry. For now, he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community. \"I should be knighted for this,\" he adds, with a wry chuckle, \"People are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Anglers \\'could face prosecution\\'\\n\\nAnglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.\\n\\nSloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. The MPs said they were \"concerned\" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.\\n\\nThey called for a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect \"kept animals\" and \"companion\" animals by setting up a \"duty of care\". In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing \"mutilation\" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal\\'s best interest.\\n\\nThe environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. \"We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government\\'s intention to exempt fishing as an activity.\"\\n\\nBut the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. \"However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given \\'carte blanche\\' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,\" the committee added. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which \"would be significantly weakened\". MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.\\n\\nCommittee chairman Michael Jack said: \"Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. \"This draft bill is no exception. My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn\\'t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.\" But Mr Jack said the bill \"very much had the feel of a \\'work in progress\\', and urged the government to guarantee that \"an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law\" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms. \"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,\" he added.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hospital suspends \\'no Welsh\\' plan\\n\\nAn English hospital has suspended plans to stop treating Welsh patients who have waited more than three months.\\n\\nHereford County Hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. GPs in Wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. But after talks with Powys Health Board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in January. Hereford Hospital Trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. Shocked health officials in Powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. Andy Williams, chief executive of Powys Local Health Board, had said it was \"a totally unacceptable way to behave\".\\n\\nMr Williams had said he did not think it was a Welsh-English issue, but said Hereford hospital was \"struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to Powys\". He had told BBC Radio Wales: \"I have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients I am paying them to treat.\" But after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, Mr Williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure Welsh patients continued to be treated there. He said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between England and Wales.\\n\\nThe target is 12 months for Welsh patients, but just three months in England. The contract with the Powys health board was worth Â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients. In a statement before the suspension of the idea, the Welsh Assembly Government said the situation was \"unacceptable\". \"But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate,\" said the assembly government. \"Although we will be challenging Hereford\\'s decision we will put in place appropriate care for our patients. They will be contacted by their GPs in the next week.\" Earlier, David Rose, Chief Executive of Hereford Hospitals NHS Trust, had said: \"It is with real regret that we have taken this step. \"We want to continue providing an excellent and fast service to Powys people but can only do this if we are paid to provide the service. \"In 2005 our waiting time will fall to a maximum of 6-months and we want Powys people to ask to be referred to our modern hospital. \"We appeal to Powys Local Health Board to allow Powys people to choose Hereford for their treatment.\"\\n',\n",
       " \"Italy 8-38 Wales\\n\\nWales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome.\\n\\nTries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in.\\n\\nStephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.\\n\\nHenson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.\\n\\nWales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.\\n\\nHenson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.\\n\\nWith Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.\\n\\nR de Marigny; Mirco Bergamasco, W Pozzebon, A Masi, L Nitoglia; L Orquera, A Troncon; A Lo Cicero, F Ongaro, M Castrogiovanni, S Dellape, M Bortolami (capt), A Persico, Mauro Bergamasco, S Parisse.\\n\\nG Intoppa, S Perugini, CA del Fava, D dal Maso, P Griffen, M Barbini, KP Robertson.\\n\\nG Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.\\n\\nR McBryde, J Yapp, I Gough, R Sowden-Taylor, G Cooper, C Sweeney, K Morgan.\\n\\nAndrew Cole (Australia).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Terror suspects face house arrest\\n\\nUK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.\\n\\nIt comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. Charles Clarke\\'s planned \"control orders\" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging. The Law Society dubbed Mr Clarke\\'s new proposals an \"abuse of power\". Deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in Belmarsh Prison in London under the current laws introduced after the US terror attacks on 11 September 2001. Mr Clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt and Jordan without them facing torture or death.\\n\\nUnder the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.\\n\\nBritish citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. Mr Clarke also said intelligence reports showed some British nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. Human rights lawyer Clive Stafford-Smith said the plans were a \"further abuse of human rights in Britain\".\\n\\nMr Clarke said prosecutions were the government\\'s first preference and promised the powers would only be used in \"serious\" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.\\n\\nHe told MPs: \"There remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation.\" He accepted the law lords\\' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. The current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat, he told MPs.\\n\\nThere have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but Mr Clarke refused to back that change.\\n\\nHe said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources\\' lives at risk. Most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at Belmarsh prison, in London. Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis was worried about extending special powers to cover British citizens. He warned: \"Throughout history, internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates. \"So unless the process is clearly just, the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists.\" He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be \"very high indeed\" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. Shami Chakrabarti, from human rights group Liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. She said: \"Adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. The government should not swap one human rights \\'opt out\\' for another.\"\\n',\n",

However, Nestle\\'s profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.\\n\\nNestle said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the US dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in Europe all dented sales. A poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. Sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.\\n\\nElsewhere, Nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in North America, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. Nestle added that it had performed strongly in Africa and Asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. Nestle\\'s total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. As well as increasing its dividend, Nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn Swiss francs ($861m; Â£451m). Looking forward, Nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.\\n\\nUncertainty remains over the future of Perrier, the iconic French mineral water owned by Nestle. Perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead Nestle to consider selling the firm. \"The option of selling is Perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive Peter Brabeck-Letmathe confirmed on Thursday.\\n',\n",

But he came back to the show in September 2003. The audience for BBC One\\'s one-hour special averaged 13.7 million and peaked at 14.2 million in the last 15 minutes, overnight figures showed. Den died after being confronted by Zoe, Chrissie and Sam in the Queen Vic.\\n\\nIf the ratings are confirmed, the episode will have given the soap its highest audience for a year. The overnight figures showed almost 60% of the viewing public tuned into EastEnders between 2000 and 2100 GMT, leaving ITV1 with about 13%. \"We are very pleased with the figures,\" a BBC spokesman said. \"It shows viewers have really enjoyed the story of Den\\'s demise.\" The show\\'s highest audience came at Christmas 1986, when more than 30 million tuned in to see Den, played by Leslie Grantham, hand divorce papers to wife Angie.\\n\\nTwo years later, 24 million saw him apparently shot by a man with a bunch of daffodils by a canal. More than 16 million viewers watched his return in 2003. The show\\'s ratings have since settled down to about 12 million per episode. Grantham hit the headlines in May after a newspaper printed photographs of him apparently exposing himself via a webcam from his dressing room. He also allegedly insulted four co-stars.

       " 'Unilever shake up as profit slips\\n\\nAnglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever is to merge its two management boards after reporting \"unsatisfactory\" earnings for 2004.\\n\\nIt blamed the poor results on sluggish decision making, a rise in discounted retailers and a wet European summer. The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range. Unilever, which owns brands including Dove soap, said annual pre-tax profit fell 36% to 2.9bn euros (Â£1.99bn). Shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in London, and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in Amsterdam.\\n\\nUnder the restructuring plans, Patrick Cescau, the UK-based co-chairman, will become group chief executive. Dutch co-chairman Antony Burgmans will take on the role of non-executive chairman.\\n\\n\"We have recognised the need for greater clarity of leadership and we are moving to a simpler leadership structure that will provide a sharper operational focus,\" Mr Burgmans said. \"We are leaving behind one of the key features of Unilever\\'s governance but this is a natural development following the changes introduced last year.\" The company, which has had dual headquarters in Rotterdam and London since 1930, will announce the location of its head office at a later date. Unilever is not alone in trying to simplify its business. Oil giant Shell last year dismantled its dual-ownership structure, after a series of problems relating to the size of its oil reserves that hammered its share price and led to the resignation of key board members. \"The best part of the news this morning was that the company announced a structure simplification,\" said Arjan Sweere, an analyst at Petercam.\\n\\nThe company said the organizational changes would speed decision making, and it also may make further changes.\\n\\nThe company said its main focus will be on improving profits, and it is planning to accelerate and increase investment in its 400 main brands. \"While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share,\" said Mr Cescau. \"We let a range of targets limit our ability flexibility and did not adjust our plans quickly enough to a more difficult business environment.\" \"Our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth.\"\\n\\nUnilever said European sales fell 2.8% last year, dragged down by below part sales at its beverage division, where revenues dipped by almost 4%.\\n\\nSales of ice cream and frozen food dipped by 3.4% In the US last year, revenue grew by 1.5% \"despite disappointing sales in Slimfast\", the company said. In Asia, leading products came under \"attack\" from rivals such as Procter & Gamble. Unilever took a 1.5bn euro one-time charge in the fourth quarter, including a 650m euro write-down on Slimfast diet foods. Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet. But looking ahead, Unilever said it was optimistic about prospects for its slimming products saying that demand is on the wane for rival low-carbohydrate diets. The company also said it planned to spend 500m euros this year buying back shares.\\n',\n",
       " 'Gallery unveils interactive tree\\n\\nA Christmas tree that can receive text messages has been unveiled at London\\'s Tate Britain art gallery.\\n\\nThe spruce has an antenna which can receive Bluetooth texts sent by visitors to the Tate. The messages will be \"unwrapped\" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.\\n\\nThe plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery\\'s foyer. Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string. The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children\\'s charity ArtWorks. Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s, while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades. Wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane, everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table.\\n',\n",
       " 'US crude prices surge above $53\\n\\nUS crude prices have soared to fresh four-month highs above $53 in the US as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all-time high.\\n\\nUS light sweet crude futures jumped to $53.09 a barrel in New York before closing at $53.03. The gains tracked a surge in US gasoline futures to a record high of $1.4850 a gallon. The jump followed a fire at Western Refining Company\\'s refinery in Texas, which shut down petrol production. A spokesman for the group was unable to say when the production unit would be back up and running. \"This market simply wants to go up,\" Citigroup Global Markets analyst Kyle Cooper told Reuters news agency. Ed Silliere, analyst at Energy Merchant, added: \"Gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in Texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the (US) Gulf Coast.\"\\n\\nElsewhere, a refinery in Houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on Tuesday production at BP\\'s Texas City refinery was taken down for a short time. In the approach to Spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season. The rise in prices came despite a US government report that showed domestic supplies of fuel oil and fuel were rising. Meanwhile, oil production cartel Opec\\'s recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. Oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that Opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. Instability in Iraq and underlying fears about terrorism have also played a part in the rally.\\n',\n",
       " 'Clarke plans migrant point scheme\\n\\nAnyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.\\n\\nHe is proposing a points system similar to Australia\\'s but would avoid the quota system planned by the Tories. Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but \"needed proper policing\". The Lib Dems say they will look at his plans, but Tory Liam Fox said his party offered a \"clear choice\" on the issue. The Conservative Party Co-Chairman said the British electorate had a choice between a Labour government that had \"done nothing for eight years and will not set a limit\" on immigration and a Tory one that would impose quotas.\\n\\nThe home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to \"ensure we can know everybody who is in the country\". Speaking on BBC One\\'s Breakfast with Frost, he said \"economic migrants are of great value to this country\", but stressed that proper policing was needed to ensure that they do not become a \"burden on society\". He said: \"We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.\"\\n\\nThe home secretary, whose five-year blueprint for immigration and asylum is expected to be published on Monday, also rejected claims that the immigration debate encouraged bigotry. \"The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,\" he said. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office\\'s ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.\"\\n\\nMr Howard has said Britain should take its fair share of the world\\'s \"genuine refugees\". But he claims the current asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain\\'s generosity. Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, called on Mr Clarke to denounce the suggestion Britain\\'s hospitality was being tested by immigration. \"Tell that to the 44,000 doctors in the NHS and the 70,000 nurses without whom we would really see what pressure on the health service means,\" he said. \"Ditto the teachers, from South Africa, Australia, Jamaica, who are reducing the sizes of our classes and schools.\" The Refugee Council said Mr Howard\\'s proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.\\n',\n",

The release of the media add-on is an attempt by the Japanese games giant to protect its dominance of the handheld gaming market. Nintendo said the media adapter will be available from February in Japan.\\n\\nThe Nintendo DS is the successor to the hugely successful GameBoy handheld game console and went on sale in Japan on 2 December. The DS has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on-board a short-range wireless link that lets people play against each other.\\n\\nThe launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the Sony PSP which was built as a multi-purpose media player and game gadget from the start. Sony is thought to be preparing pre-packaged movies and music for the PSP. The add-on will also work with the GameBoy Advance SP. Nintendo dominates the handheld gaming console world thanks to successive versions of the GameBoy. More than 28 million GameBoy Advance handhelds have been sold around the world. The dual-screen DS is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. Nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside Japan. When it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen (Â£25), roughly the difference in price between the DS and the higher-priced Sony PSP.\\n',\n",
       " \"ID theft surge hits US consumers\\n\\nAlmost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest.\\n\\nThe Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud. ID theft occurs when criminals use someone else's personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (Â£290m).\\n\\nThe report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people's credit. Misusing someone's identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. Another 18% came from attempts to rip off people's bank accounts, while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else's identity. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. Among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oil prices reach three-month low\\n\\nOil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that US crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.\\n\\nLondon Brent crude closed at $40.15 on Thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-September. US light crude traded in New York lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 September. The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. The news calmed worries about winter shortages. Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"It\\'s amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.\\n\\nThe stronger fuel inventories helped boost US stock markets to nine-month highs on Wednesday, though only the Nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of Thursday.\\n\\nIn London, the FTSE 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.\\n\\nThe price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September. Traders were also encouraged by comments on Wednesday from the energy minister of Opec member Algeria. Chakib Khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec\\'s attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.\\n\\nFears still remain over the level of US heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. A cold spell in north America would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"Mother Nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said Kyle Cooper, at Citigroup Global Markets. \"Long term I think we\\'re headed to $30-35 but I don\\'t think we\\'re doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left.\" John Person, president of National Futures Advisory Services, said the EIA data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the US. .\\n',\n",
       " '\\'No re-draft\\' for EU patent law\\n\\nA proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs.\\n\\nThe law is proving controversial and has been in limbo for a year. Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms. The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review \"all aspects of the directive\". The directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, \"computer implemented invention\".\\n\\nIn a letter, EC President Jos&#233; Manuel Barroso told the President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, that the Commission \"did not intend to refer a new proposal to the Parliament and the Council (of ministers)\" as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in May 2004.\\n\\nIf the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament. But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive. Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. French Green MEP Alain Lipietz warned two weeks ago that if the Commission ignored the Parliament\\'s request it would be an \"insult\" to the assembly. He said that the parliament would then reject the Council\\'s version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure. In the US, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is permitted.\\n\\nThis means that the US-based Amazon.com holds a patent for its \"one-click shopping\" service, for example. Critics are concerned that the directive could lead to a similar model happening in Europe. This, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.\\n',\n",

Last year\\'s Meltdown festival, directed by the ex-Smiths star Morrissey, included appearances by singer Jane Birkin, Nancy Sinatra and playwright Alan Bennett.

       " 'Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction\\n\\nA little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.\\n\\nBaikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: Â£4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.\\n\\n\"The company considers that the victor of today\\'s auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,\" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make \"every lawful move\" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from \"this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property\". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders\\' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.\\n\\nThe sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm\\'s bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.\\n\\nMystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: \"I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.\\n\\n\"I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. \"I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. \"Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price.\" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: \"I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. \"Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises.\" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.\\n\\nThe US bankruptcy court\\'s initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos\\' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC\\'s Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.\\n',\n",

He told delegates that Labour had abused the public\\'s trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them. In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the \"forgotten majority\".\\n\\nSpeaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: \"People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.\"\\n\\nOnly the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government\\'s plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation. He said: \"If you voted Conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you? Your vote was wasted. \"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister.\" Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: \"Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives.\"\\n\\nMr Kennedy also outlined his party\\'s plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over Â£100,000 a year. The money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. Labour and the Tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. Mr Kennedy said: \"Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have world class businesses and a world class workforce.\\n\\n\"So why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line?\" All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing. Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4\\'s Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament. \"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,\" he said. Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday\\'s Commons vote on the government\\'s controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs. On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was \"just a cock-up\" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. \"Nobody had any idea that was going to happen,\" Lord Rennard told reporters at the party conference.

       " 'Speech takes on search engines\\n\\nA Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.\\n\\nCalled Speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results. Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November. But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.\\n\\nThe Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. The ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.\\n\\nAccording to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. People visiting Speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the BBC and Reuters. \"It is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad,\" said Speegle founder Gordon Renton. \"The system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. \"We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology,\" he added. But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people\\'s experience of the web. \"There are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,\" she said. \"Blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way,\" she added.\\n\\nThe site uses a technology dubbed PanaVox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. In the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but CEC says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google. Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton. \"It is not a rip-off. We are doing something that Google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,\" he said. Speegle is proving popular with those learning English in countries such as Japan and China. \"The site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. The repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots,\" said Mr Renton.\\n',\n",

Ceri Sweeney, Gareth Cooper, Ian Gough and Kevin Morgan have been used sparingly by Ruddock in the opening two Six Nations wins and captain Jason Forster believes they would benefit from a game with the Dragons.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure the guys would want to come back to get some game time,\" Forster told BBC Wales Sport. \"It would also be a timely reminder to Mike [Ruddock] as to what they can do. \"And the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch.\" Ruddock, though, is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue. \"At this stage, there\\'s nothing more [the players] can do in games to impress me further. \"We\\'ve got to look at it at another angle and see the opportunities that are provided for the younger players in the region. \"For example, the Dragons might use James Ireland this weekend. I\\'ve been looking at the lad - he\\'s a great prospect for the future.\" French and English clubs have requested to have all their international players available which means Stephen Jones, Gareth Thomas and Mefin Davies will play this weekend. The majority of Ireland and Scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.\\n',\n",
       " 'Game warnings \\'must be clearer\\'\\n\\nViolent video games should carry larger warnings so parents can understand what their children are playing, the trade and industry secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt is expected to call for the law banning the sale of 18-rated games to children to be enforced better at a games industry meeting on Sunday. She is concerned too many children are playing games aimed at adults which include \"high levels of violence\". Parents are expected to spend millions on video games as Christmas presents.\\n\\nViolent games have been hit by controversy after the game Manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in Leicester in February. His mother, Giselle, said her son\\'s killer, Warren Leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in September - had mimicked behaviour in the game. Police investigating the Stefan\\'s murder dismissed its influence and Manhunt was not part of its legal case. Ahead of Sunday\\'s meeting in London, Ms Hewitt said she was proud of the UK\\'s \"vibrant games industry\" but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. Roger Bennett, head of gaming industry body ELSPA, said banning violent games would be wrong. He said: \"We don\\'t want to go down that route. We have seen that the government is supportive of the industry.\" The government is holding a further meeting on Friday with industry and retail representatives as well as the British Board of Film Classification to discuss how labelling can be made clearer. Ms Hewitt said: \"Adults should be treated as adults and children as children. It is important that retailers respect the classifications and do not sell games with high levels of violence to minors.\\n\\n\"Equally parents need to know what they might be buying for their children. \"Video games are different to films or videos, and not all parents have grown up playing games in the way our children do. \"We need to look carefully at how we improve content warnings and strengthen sales enforcement.\" Her call was backed by Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell who said: \"You wouldn\\'t let your child watch the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You wouldn\\'t let them go to a strip club. \"So you shouldn\\'t let them play an 18-rated game. It\\'s the same principle - adults can make their own informed choices, but children can\\'t always and need to be protected.\" Anyone convicted of selling an 18-rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to Â£5,000. Rockstar Games, the makers of Manhunt, has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.\\n',\n",

But Corry has backed Robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half Jonny Wilkinson, ahead of this weekend\\'s trip to Ireland. \"Jason is doing a tremendous job. Every week my respect for him goes up,\" Corry told BBC Radio Five Live. \"He is an inspirational captain. When he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense. \"The players have a lot of respect for him. It\\'s an honour to be in the England side and an honour to play under him.\"\\n\\nEngland are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their Six Nations campaign. But Corry insists England are in the right frame of mind for the contest. \"There is apprehension going into every game,\" he added. \"But you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset. \"When the whistle goes on Sunday, what has happened in the past does not count for anything.\\n\\n\"We have not performed but if we put in a performance on Sunday then we can start turning results around. \"There are a lot of changes taking place with England and we are at the start of something. We have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.\"\\n\\nA trip to Lansdowne Road is daunting at any time, especially against an Ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. They are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first Grand Slam since 1948. But Corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the Irish in their own backyard. \"They are full of confidence and are playing a great team game,\" he said. \"The forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide. \"If you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15. It\\'s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us. \"Lansdowne Road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.\"\\n',\n",

Nintendo said 15 games would be available in the UK at launch, with prices ranging from Â£19 to Â£29. More than 2.8 million DS consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the US and Japan at the end of 2004. Rival Sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the PSP, in the US and Europe before the end of March. The PSP is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite Sony\\'s assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.\\n\\nThe 15 games available on the European launch date will include Nintendo\\'s Super Mario 64 DS, as well as titles from third-party developers such as Ubisoft\\'s Rayman DS.\\n\\nMore than 120 games are in development for the new console, Nintendo has said. The DS is backwards compatible with the Game Boy Advance, allowing the earlier machine\\'s back catalogue of 700 games to be played. Additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the DS, with a \"download play\" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. Other features include a short-range messaging application called Pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in Sega\\'s launch title Project Rub. Nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.\\n\\nThe launch price of Â£99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the US price of $149, according to John Houlihan, editor of the Computerandvideogames.com magazine. \"It\\'s a very, very competitive price point. There are some innovative features, and Nintendo has created quite a buzz,\" he says. \"However, the line-up of games could have been stronger. Everyone wanted to see the eight-player Mario Kart DS, for example.\"\\n\\nMr Houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the Nintendo DS and Sony\\'s new PSP, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. \"The PSP is a sexy bit of kit, but Sony\\'s attitude to the PSP has been very understated in Europe, so far,\" Mr Houlihan said. The worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts Screen Digest.\\n\\nIn the past, games consoles and handhelds have generally launched much later in Europe than in other parts of the world. However Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the company was \"pleased to have offered such a short period of time between the US and European launch\". \"Europe is an extremely important market for Nintendo,\" Mr Iwata added. Nintendo raised its sales targets for the DS console last December after selling a million in the US and Japan in just a few weeks.\\n',\n",

He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.\\n\\nIn what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and \"throwing crockery\". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: \"It\\'s a fight for the future of our country, it\\'s a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.\"\\n\\nMr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents\\' policies and then attacking the lies. \"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it\\'s going to be fear and smear,\" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour\\'s six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid Â£500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. \"We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,\" he said, insisting he enjoyed a \"warm and constructive\" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.\\n\\nMeanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair\\'s words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay.

Better records and greater prosperity of Mexican expatriates in the US are the main reasons behind the increase. About 10 million Mexicans live in the US, where there are 16 million citizens of Mexican origin. Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country's GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico's figures. Last year, there were 50.9 million transactions, with an average value of $327 per remittance, the bank said. According to Standard & Poor's, which has recently upgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices.\\n\\nThe growth in remittances has sparked fierce competition between banks. Bank of America announced last week that it planned to eliminate transfer fees for some customers. Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said.

The EU has opted to adopt qualified majority voting in this area - previously measures needed unanimous agreement from all member states. Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.\\n\\nHe argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK. \"If we don\\'t like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people,\" he said. The home secretary was responding to an emergency question from his Tory opposite number Mr Davis. \"The government is employing the politics of confusion - I think, deliberately,\" argued Mr Davis. \"By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto.\" On Monday Tony Blair insisted closer co-operation did not mean losing control of British borders. He said an enlarged 25-member EU needs a streamlined decision making process. Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant.\\n\\nHe accused the government of being \"pathetic\" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of \"surrendering\" on the issue. And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over. Mr Blair told his monthly news conference Britain had the \"best of both worlds\" and would keep the veto. \"There is no question of Britain giving up our veto on our border controls,\" he said. \"With the Treaty of Amsterdam seven years ago, we secured the absolute right to opt in to any of the asylum and immigration provisions that we wanted to in Europe.\" Mr Blunkett met his EU counterparts in Luxembourg on Monday to consider proposals aimed at streamlining decision making on the issue.\\n\\nThe 25 member-states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting (QMV) system. Under this scheme larger states such as Britain are expected to have more power than the smaller EU states. Britain is expected to retain an \"opt-in\" right which will allow it to ignore any measures it disagrees with. Liberal Democrat spokesman Mark Oaten called the change pragmatic and argued it gave a better chance of producing a European asylum solution. \"If we don\\'t work together it means some countries can ignore their responsibilities at the expense of their neighbours,\" said Mr Oaten. \"The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it\\'s right that we don\\'t do this in isolation.\"\\n',\n",

The two-screen clamshell gadget costs Â£99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as Super Mario and Rayman. The DS spearheads Nintendo\\'s attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.\\n\\nSince going on sale in Japan and the US at the end of 2004, Nintendo has sold almost 4m DS consoles.\\n\\nPart of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo\\'s GameBoy Advance handheld. Games for the DS are expected to cost between Â£19 and Â£29. About 130 games for the DS are in development.\\n\\nAs well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. A \"download play\" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. Other DS owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. Nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS. \"We know that customers want it as soon as it\\'s released - and that means the minute, not the day,\" said Robert Quinn, Game\\'s UK sales director.\\n\\nBut Nintendo will only have sole control of Europe\\'s handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon Sony is expected to release its PSP console. Although Nintendo is aiming for younger players and the PSP is more for older gamers, it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. Sony\\'s PSP represents a real threat to Nintendo because of the huge number of PlayStation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. The PSP uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. When it goes on sale the PSP is likely to cost between Â£130 and Â£200.\\n',\n",

That game is one Smith would be delighted to see reinstated. \"The Scotland v England match was a highlight of the end of the season,\" he added. \"I was in Italy for their friendly with Russia last week and they made seven substitutions while only around 20,000 fans turned up to watch. \"England were criticised for the 0-0 draw against Holland - the way Scotland were slammed in the past for poor results in friendlies. \"You have to put a performance on in friendly games. If you don\\'t, they can be de-motivating. \"It can be a dangerous road to go down, if players don\\'t apply themselves in the manner they should. \"So I would support the return of the home internationals - the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.\"\\n',\n",
       " 'Text message record smashed again\\n\\nUK mobile owners continue to break records with their text messaging, with latest figures showing that 26 billion texts were sent in total in 2004.\\n\\nThe figures collected by the Mobile Data Association (MDA) showed that 2.4 billion were fired off in December alone, the highest monthly total ever. That was 26% more than in December 2003. The records even surpassed the MDA\\'s own predictions, it said. Every day 78 million messages are sent and there are no signs of a slow down. Before December\\'s bumper text record, the previous highest monthly total was in October 2004, when 2.3 billion were sent. Text messaging is set to smash more records in 2005 too, said the MDA, with forecasts suggesting a total of 30 billion for the year.\\n\\nEven though mobiles are becoming increasingly sophisticated with much more multimedia applications, texting is still one of the most useful functions of mobiles. People are using SMS to do much more too. Booking cinema tickets, text voting, and news or sports text alerts are growing popular. Mobile owners have also given the chance to donate to the Disasters Emergency Committee\\'s (DEC) Asian Tsunami fund by texting \"Donate\" to a simple short code number. Looking further ahead in the year, the MDA\\'s chairman Mike Short, has predicted that more people will go online through their mobiles, estimating 15 billion WAP page impressions. Handsets with GPRS capability - an \"always on\" net connection - will rise to 75%, while 3G mobile ownership growing to five million by the end of 2005. These third generation mobiles offer a high-speed connection which means more data like video can be received on the phone. Globally, mobile phone sales passed 167 million in the third quarter of 2004, according to a recent report from analysts Gartner. That was 26% more than the previous year. It is predicted that there would be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.\\n',\n",
       " 'Standard Life cuts policy bonuses\\n\\nStandard Life, Europe\\'s largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.\\n\\nAnnual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.\\n\\nWith-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. Profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.\\n\\nJohn Gill, managing director of the insurer\\'s life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only \"partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002\". In addition, low interest rates meant that \"long-term investment returns are well below historic levels\", Mr Gill added. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. \"Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,\" he said. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. Last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.\\n',\n",
       " 'House prices drop as sales slow\\n\\nHouse prices fell further in November and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found.\\n\\nA total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. \"The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,\" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said. \"The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.\"\\n\\nThe figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than Â£600 from Â£190,329 in November to Â£189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more \"moderate\", RICS added. But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. \"Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,\" Mr Perry added. Looking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the market picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over the coming 12 months.\\n',\n",

Martin Freeman, John Malkovich, Bill Nighy and Alan Rickman are co-starring in the film, due for release in May. The late Douglas Adams\\' original 1977 scripts have also been turned into a series of successful books.\\n\\n\"Being asked to do the voice of The Guide is like having your birthday on Christmas Day, discovering a winning lottery ticket in your stocking and having chocolate poured all over you,\" said Fry, a self-confessed fan of the book. The film\\'s executive producer Robbie Stamp said that Adams, who died in 2001, would have been \"delighted\" with the choice of Fry for the role.\\n\\n\"His humour and intelligence are perfect for the voice of The Guide,\" added Mr Stamp. Adams wrote the screenplay based on his book before his premature death, while a new radio series was aired 26 years after the first broadcast and included many of the original cast members. Hollywood star Malkovich will play religious cult leader Humma Kavula, which was especially created by Adams for the new film. Freeman, who starred in hit BBC comedy The Office, will play the role of Arthur Dent, who begins his intergalactic voyage following the destruction of the Earth.\\n',\n",
       " 'Protect whistleblowers, TUC says\\n\\nThe government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the TUC has said.\\n\\nIt said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 \"safety whistleblowers\" had lost their jobs since 1999. Some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said. The Health and Safety Executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. The TUC figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.\\n\\nSafety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation. General secretary Brendan Barber said: \"It shouldn\\'t be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. \"Workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety.\" Mr Barber, who said the \"problem is far worse than official statistics show\", called for a legal system that \"protects safety whistleblowers\". He added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, \"stand little chance of redress.\"\\n\\nRory O\\' Neill, editor of union-backed Hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: \"Giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. \"Death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century. \"It would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect.\" The TUC has called on the government to appoint \"roving\" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. The Health and Safety Executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement.\\n',\n",
       " 'Digital UK driven by net and TV\\n\\nThe UK\\'s adoption of digital TV and broadband has helped make it the fourth most digitally-savvy nation in Europe, according a report by Jupiter Research.\\n\\nBut the UK still lags in terms of broadband speeds compared to others. The most digitally sophisticated Europeans, in terms of use of digital goods such as mobiles, TV, net and cameras, are the Scandinavians. About 14 million households in the UK, 60%, have digital TV, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The least digital of the European nations was Greece, in 17th position, according to the Digital Life Index.\\n\\nScandinavian countries Sweden, Denmark and Norway came out top in the report, but there were some differences in technology trends. \"The European Digital Life Index demonstrates that digital lifestyles are common today, but across Europe there is no single digital lifestyle,\" said Nate Elliott, Jupiter analyst. \"Consumers adopt different digital products and services in different countries.\"\\n\\nAlthough there are differences between different European nations, the gap between them is closing, the report concluded. The trend for gadgets and technologies, such as digital video recorders (DVR), broadband, and video-on-demand will continue across Europe, he added. More than six million UK households now have broadband net. By the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all UK net users will be on broadband. Cable company NTL is trialling faster ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) broadband technology using ADSL2+ which can give speeds of 18Mbps compared to current speeds which are usually around 1Mbps or 2Mbps. BT is set to trial the technology later in the year. Super-fast broadband will be necessary to the delivery of services such as high-definition TV (HDTV) and video-on-demand, already very popular in France and other European countries.\\n\\nA separate survey by GMIPoll last week found that, globally, people\\'s appetite for technology and gadgets continues unabated. The poll of 20,000 people in 20 countries found that 59% wanted more technology.\\n\\nThe computer was the \"must-have\" gadget for most people (75%). The TV took second place (67%), while the mobile was ranked in third position with 54%. Digital cameras were the most popular choice of gadget for 2005, said the survey, with nearly 40% choosing this over wireless, home printing and DVR technologies. However, only 25% of Britons said a digital camera would be their top gadget purchase of the year. Almost a quarter, 22%, said they would be buying some sort of wireless device. Forty-four percent said they would be buying something \"other\". This might include digital music players, or gaming devices. The Nintendo DS, Sony\\'s PSP and Gizmondo all hit the shops in 2005, and the first of the next generation of games consoles, Xbox 2, is set to launch later this year. Jupiter Research\\'s index is calculated using 40 different variables across net users, digital TV adoption, wireless and mobile, online activity, and digital devices.\\n',\n",

       " 'Beastie Boys win sampling battle\\n\\nUS rappers Beastie Boys have won their long-running battle over the use of a sample in their song Pass the Mic.\\n\\nThe punk-rappers used three notes of music from flautist James Newton\\'s Choir in their track from 1992. Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.\\n\\nSampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton\\'s recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. \"We hold that Beastie Boys\\' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton\\'s copyright,\" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion. Mr Newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist, composer, performer, and university professor. Mr Newton and the Beastie Boys were not available for comment.\\n',\n",
       " 'Video phone help for deaf people\\n\\nDeaf people who prefer to communicate using British Sign Language (BSL) could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.\\n\\nThe Video Relay Service is being piloted by the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people\\'s pockets. The RNID is urging telecoms regulator, Ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current Â£7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls. The service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a BSL interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person\\'s conversation using a telephone and translates the other person\\'s response into sign language.\\n\\nFor many deaf people, especially those born deaf, BSL is a first and preferred means of communication.\\n\\nUntil now, the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator. \"In the past, I\\'ve used textphones but they have problems,\" said Robert Currington who is taking part in the pilot. \"I communicate in BSL; my written English is not very good and it takes me longer to think in English and type my message.\" \"I sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply.\" The RNID says the UK is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call. \"There are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people,\" said RNID technology director, Guido Gybels. \"In the US and Australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call. \"By failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users, the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group.\"\\n\\nOfcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year. And new technology, including the Video Relay Service, will be discussed with interested parties in the near future. But a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation. \"Any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider,\" he said. Mr Currington, like many of the UK\\'s 70,000 BSL users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost-effective service available. \"The relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure,\" he said. \"I can show my emotions more easily in BSL in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls.\"\\n',\n",

This is especially useful when classifying short texts (e.g. one or a few sentences) as this kind of tasks can be very sensitive to understanding the meaning resulting from intra-sentence interactions between words. The next session on attentional mechanisms and pre-trained transformer-based word models will explain this in more details.\n",
